# Mute v4 — Task List for Implementation

**Design doc:** [MUTE_V4_DESIGN.md](MUTE_V4_DESIGN.md)

**Branch:** mute_version_4

---

## Phase 1: Mute Files per Build Type

- [ ] **1.1** Create empty mute files for sanitizers: `muted_ya_asan.txt`, `muted_ya_tsan.txt`, `muted_ya_msan.txt`
- [ ] **1.2** Add helper to get mute file path by build_type: `get_muted_ya_path(build_type) -> path`
- [ ] **1.3** Update `test_ya/action.yml` to use correct mute file based on `BUILD_PRESET`
- [ ] **1.4** Update `mute_utils.py convert_muted_txt_to_yaml` to accept file path parameter
- [ ] **1.5** Update `update_muted_ya.yml` to process per build_type (matrix or loop)
- [ ] **1.6** Update `create_new_muted_ya.py` to accept `--muted_ya_file` and `--output_file` per build_type

---

## Phase 2: Quarantine Infrastructure

- [ ] **2.1** Create `quarantine.txt` (empty initially)
- [ ] **2.2** Add `YaQuarantineCheck` or extend mute_check to load quarantine
- [ ] **2.3** Implement `effective_muted = muted - quarantine` in mute application logic
- [ ] **2.4** Update `transform_build_results.py` / mute application to use effective_muted
- [ ] **2.5** Exclude quarantine tests from `to_mute` in `create_new_muted_ya.py`

---

## Phase 3: Manual vs Auto Unmute Detection

- [ ] **3.1** Add cache save/restore to `update_muted_ya.yml`: `mute_state` with keys: `previous_base_tests`, `our_to_unmute`, `our_new_muted_ya_hash`
- [ ] **3.2** Implement detection logic: `removed = previous_base - current_base`
- [ ] **3.3** For each removed test: if not in `our_to_unmute` → add to quarantine.txt
- [ ] **3.4** Persist quarantine.txt changes in PR (when creating update PR)
- [ ] **3.5** Handle first run (no cache): skip detection, no false manual unmutes

---

## Phase 4: Quarantine Graduation

- [ ] **4.1** Add query/aggregation for 1-day window: runs and passes per test
- [ ] **4.2** Implement graduation check: 4+ runs in 1 day AND 1+ pass
- [ ] **4.3** For tests passing graduation: remove from quarantine, remove from muted_ya
- [ ] **4.4** Integrate graduation into `create_new_muted_ya` or separate step in workflow

---

## Phase 5: Integration & Workflow Updates

- [ ] **5.1** Update `update_muted_ya.yml` full flow: cache restore → detection → quarantine load → create_new_muted_ya (with quarantine exclusion) → graduation → cache save
- [ ] **5.2** Update `collect_analytics.yml` if it uses muted_ya (per build_type)
- [ ] **5.3** Update `create_issues_for_muted_tests.yml` for multi-file if needed
- [ ] **5.4** Update `get_muted_tests.py upload_muted_tests` for per build_type files
- [ ] **5.5** Update `mute_rules.md` documentation

---

## Phase 6: Testing & Validation

- [ ] **6.1** Test manual unmute flow: remove test, merge, verify quarantine
- [ ] **6.2** Test quarantine graduation: 4 runs / 1 day with 1 pass
- [ ] **6.3** Test that quarantine tests don't get re-muted
- [ ] **6.4** Test per build_type mute file selection in CI
