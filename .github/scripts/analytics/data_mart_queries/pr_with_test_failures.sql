-- Все PR с информацией об упавших тестах в PR-check.
--
-- Логика:
--   1. Берём все PR из github_data/pull_requests (дедуплицируем по последнему exported_at).
--   2. Для каждого PR ищем последний запуск PR-check за $test_lookback_days дней.
--   3. Определяем, заблокирован ли PR тестами:
--      - is_pr_blocked_by_tests_in_last_run_and_try = 1, если в последнем запуске
--        на третьей попытке (attempt = 3) есть падения.
--      - Третья попытка — финальная; если тест упал и там, значит PR заблокирован.
--   4. LEFT JOIN к детальной информации о каждом упавшем тесте:
--      full_name, job_id, branch, logs, owners и т.д.
--
-- Результат: одна строка на каждую пару (PR, упавший тест). PR без падений тоже включены
-- (с пустыми полями теста).
--
-- Параметры:
--   $test_lookback_days — окно выборки тестов (дни). Ограничивает сканирование таблицы
--     test_runs_column. PR с тестами старше этого периода не попадут в выборку.
--     По умолчанию 65 ≈ 2 месяца (запас для долгоживущих PR).
