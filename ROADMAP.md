1. ㉔ **Volatile transactions**. YDB Distributed transactions 2.0, minimize network round trips in happy path
1. ㉔ **Table statistics** for cost-based optimizer
1. ㉔ **Memory optimization for row tables** (avoid full SST index loading, dynamic cache adjusting)
1. ㉔ Reduce minimum requirements for **the number of cores to 2** for YDB node
1. ㉔ **Incremental backup** and **Point-in-time recovery**
1. ㉔ **``ALTER CHANGEFEED``**

1. ㉔ **Extended Kafka API** protocol to YDB Topics support (balance reads, support for v19)
1. ㉔ **Schema for YDB Topics**
1. ㉔ **Message-level parallelism** in YDB Topics
1. ✅ ㉓ Get **YDB topics** (aka pers queue, streams) ready for production
1. ✅ ㉓ Turn on **MVCC support** by default
1. ✅ ㉓ Enable **Snapshot read mode** by default (take and use MVCC snapshot for reads instead of running distributed transaction for reads)
1. ✅ ㉓ **Change Data Capture** (be able to get change feed of table updates)
1. 🔥 ㉓ **Async Replication** between YDB databases  (first version, row tables, w/o schema changes)
1. ✅ ㉓ **Background compaction for DataShards**
1. ✅ ㉓ **Compressed Backups**. Add functionality to compress backup data
1. ㉓ Process of **Extending State Storage** without cluster downtime. If a cluster grows from, say, 9 nodes to 900 State Storage configuration stays the same (9 nodes), it leads to a performance bottleneck.
1. **Split/Merge DataShards *BY LOAD* by default**. Most users require this feature turned on by default
1. ✅ ㉓ Support **PostgreSQL datatypes** in tablet local database
1. **Basic histogram for DataShards** (first step towards cost based optimizations)
1. ✅ ㉓ **Transaction can see its own updates** (updates made during transaction execution are not buffered in RAM anymore, but rather are written to disk and available to read by this transaction)
1. ㉓ **Data Ingestion from topic to table** (implement built-in compatibility to ingest data to YDB tables from topics)
1. ㉓ Support **snapshot read over read replicas** (consistent reads against read replicas)
1. ㉓ 🚧 **Transactions between topics and tables**
1. ✅ ㉓ Support for **Kafka API compatible protocol** to YDB Topics

1. ㉓ **Self-heal for degrated BlobStorage groups** (automatic self-heal for groups with two broken disks, get VDisk Donors production ready)
1. ㉓ **BlobDepot** (a component for smooth blobs management between groups)
1. ㉓ **Avoid BSC (BlobStorage Controller) as SPF** (be able to run the cluster without BSC in emergency cases)
1. ㉓ **BSC manages static group** (reconfiguration of the static BlobStorage group must be done BlobStorage Controller as for any other group)
1. ㉓ **(Semi-)Hard disk space separation** (Better guarantees for disk space usage by VDisks on a single PDisk)
1. ㉓ **Reduce space amplification** (Optimize storage layer)
1. ㉓ **Storage nodes decommission** (Add ability to remove storage nodes)

## Analytical Capabilities

1. ㉓ 🚧 **Column-oriented Tables** (introduce a Column-oriented tables in additon to Row-orinted tables)
1. ㉓ **Tiered Storage for Column-oriented Tables** (with the ability to store the data in S3)

## Federated Query

## Embedded UI
1.  **Support for all schema entities**
    * ㉓ **YDB Topics** (add support for viewing metadata of YDB topics, its data, lag, etc)
