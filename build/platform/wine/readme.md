## These are resources of wine (Windows execution layer for Linux)
- wine32.json and wine.json describe wine for 32bit (i686) and 64bit (x86_64) tests. It is unclear why separate packages are needed. As of now this is hard-coded in ya-bin even though both resources contain wine (32bit) and wine64 (64bit) binaries. Build uses only latter since 32bit host platform is not supported, tests however use target platform to determine wine flavor to be used and so may use both.
- JSON's also contain resource for Windows host platform. It is just archive with empty directory needed to unify wine tool description among all platforms supporting Windows-targeted builds. This resource will never be actually used but as of now may be downloaded by tests due to deficiecy of implementation (YA-789). Just preserve these resources as they are upon wine updates.
