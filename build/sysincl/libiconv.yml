# We have lots of ADDINCLs to contrib/libs/libiconv all around the repo
# so we need to add it to sysincl for consistent resolving.
# We can go the other way here and remove iconv.h from all sysincl configs
# and try to fix all places where we really need iconv.h from libc
# Btw: seems that this ADDINCL should be made global and removed from projects
# that use this header
- includes:
  - iconv.h:       contrib/libs/libiconv/include/iconv.h
