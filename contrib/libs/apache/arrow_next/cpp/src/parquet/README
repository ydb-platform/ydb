The CompatibilityTest of bloom_filter-test.cc is used to test cross compatibility of
Bloom filters between parquet-mr and parquet-cpp. It reads the Bloom filter binary
generated by the Bloom filter class in the parquet-mr project and tests whether the
values inserted before could be filtered or not.

The Bloom filter binary is generated by three steps from Parquet-mr:
Step 1: Construct a Bloom filter with 1024 bytes of bitset.
Step 2: Insert hashes of "hello", "parquet", "bloom", "filter" strings to Bloom filter
by calling hash and insert APIs.
Step 3: Call writeTo API to write to File.
