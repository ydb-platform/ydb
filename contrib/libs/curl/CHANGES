  ngtcp2: advertise h3 as well as h3-29
  
  Advertise h3 as well as h3-29 since some servers out there require h3
  for QUIC v1.
  
  Closes #7979

- [Tatsuhiro Tsujikawa brought this change]

  ngtcp2: use QUIC v1 consistently
  
  Since we switched to v1 quic_transport_parameters codepoint in #7960
  with quictls, lets use QUIC v1 consistently.

- tests: add Schannel-specific tests and disable unsupported ones
  
  Adds Schannel variants of SSLpinning tests that include the option
  --ssl-revoke-best-effort to ignore certificate revocation check
  failures which is required due to our custom test CA certificate.
  
  Disable the original variants if the Schannel backend is enabled.
  
  Also skip all IDN tests which are broken while using an msys shell.
  
  This is a step to simplify test exclusions for Windows and MinGW.

  sendf: accept zero-length data in Curl_client_write()
  
  Historically, Curl_client_write() used a length value of 0 as a marker
  for a null-terminated data string. This feature has been removed in
  commit f4b85d2. To detect leftover uses of the feature, a DEBUGASSERT
  statement rejecting a length with value 0 was introduced, effectively
  precluding use of this function with zero-length data.
  
  The current commit removes the DEBUGASSERT and makes the function to
  return immediately if length is 0.
  
  A direct effect is to fix trying to output a zero-length distinguished
  name in openldap.
  
  Another DEBUGASSERT statement is also rephrased for better readability.

- Makefile.m32: fix to not require OpenSSL with -libssh2 or -rtmp options
  
  Previously, -libssh2/-rtmp options assumed that OpenSSL is also enabled

  but this isn't necessarly true, e.g. when building both libssh2 and curl
  against Schannel. This patch makes sure to only enable the OpenSSL backend
  with -libssh2/-rtmp, when there was no SSL option explicitly selected.

- http: set content length earlier
  
  - Make content length (ie download size) accessible to the user in the
    header callback, but only after all headers have been processed (ie
    only in the final call to the header callback).
  
  Background:
  
  For a long time the content length could be retrieved in the header
  callback via CURLINFO_CONTENT_LENGTH_DOWNLOAD_T as soon as it was parsed
  by curl.
  
  Changes were made in 8a16e54 (precedes 7.79.0) to ignore content length
  if any transfer encoding is used. A side effect of that was that
  content length was not set by libcurl until after the header callback
  was called the final time, because until all headers are processed it
  cannot be determined if content length is valid.
  
  This change keeps the same intention --all headers must be processed--
  but now the content length is available before the final call to the
  header function that indicates all headers have been processed (ie
  a blank header).

  accepts a name that contains space, CR or LF.

  By just glancing at the code, it looks like there is a memleak if the

- lib: avoid fallthrough cases in switch statements
  
  Commit b5a434f7f0ee4d64857f8592eced5b9007d83620 inhibits the warning
  on implicit fallthrough cases, since the current coding of indicating
  fallthrough with comments is falling out of fashion with new compilers.
  This attempts to make the issue smaller by rewriting fallthroughs to no
  longer fallthrough, via either breaking the cases or turning switch
  statements into if statements.
  
    lib/content_encoding.c: the fallthrough codepath is simply copied
      into the case as it's a single line.
    lib/http_ntlm.c: the fallthrough case skips a state in the state-
      machine and fast-forwards to NTLMSTATE_LAST. Do this before the
      switch statement instead to set up the states that we actually
      want.
    lib/http_proxy.c: the fallthrough is just falling into exiting the
      switch statement which can be done easily enough in the case.
    lib/mime.c: switch statement rewritten as if statement.
    lib/pop3.c: the fallthrough case skips to the next state in the
      statemachine, do this explicitly instead.
    lib/urlapi.c: switch statement rewritten as if statement.
    lib/vssh/wolfssh.c: the fallthrough cases fast-forwards the state
      machine, do this by running another iteration of the switch
      statement instead.
    lib/vtls/gtls.c: switch statement rewritten as if statement.
    lib/vtls/nss.c: the fallthrough codepath is simply copied into the
      case as it's a single line. Also twiddle a comment to not be
      inside a non-brace if statement.

- curl.1: remove mentions of really old version changes
  
  To make the man page more readable, this change removes all references
  to changes in support/versions etc that happened before 7.30.0 from the
  curl.1 output file. 7.30.0 was released on Apr 12 2013. This particular
  limit is a bit arbitrary but was fairly easy to grep for.
  
  It is handled like this: the 'Added' keyword is only used in output if
  it refers to 7.30.0 or later. All occurances of "(Added in $VERSION)" in
  description will be stripped out if the mentioned $VERSION is from
  before 7.30.0. It is therefore important that the "Added in..."
  references are always written exactly like that - and on a single line,
  not split over two.
  
  This change removes about 80 version number references from curl.1, down
  to 138 from 218.

  On connection shutdown, a new TLS session ticket may arrive after the

  SSL session cannot be added to the SSL session cache.
  
  The callers of Curl_ssl_addsessionid() need to know whether the SSL
  session has been added to the cache. If it has not been added, the

  used by the SSL session must be freed. This is now possible with the new

- hsts: handle unlimited expiry
  
  When setting a blank expire string, meaning unlimited, curl would pass
  TIME_T_MAX to getime_r() when creating the output, while on 64 bit
  systems such a large value cannot be convetered to a tm struct making
  curl to exit the loop with an error instead. It can't be converted
  because the year it would represent doesn't fit in the 'int tm_year'
  field!
  
  Starting now, unlimited expiry is instead handled differently by using a
  human readable expiry date spelled out as "unlimited" instead of trying
  to use a distant actual date.
  
  Test 1660 and 1915 have been updated to help verify this change.

- tool_operate: Fix --fail-early with parallel transfers
  
  - Abort via progress callback to fail early during parallel transfers.
  
  When a critical error occurs during a transfer (eg --fail-early
  constraint) then other running transfers will be aborted via progress
  callback and finish with error CURLE_ABORTED_BY_CALLBACK (42). In this
  case, the callback error does not become the most recent error and a
  custom error message is used for those transfers:
  
  curld --fail --fail-early --parallel
  https://httpbin.org/status/404 https://httpbin.org/delay/10
  
  curl: (22) The requested URL returned error: 404

- hostip: Make Curl_ipv6works function independent of getaddrinfo
  
  - Do not assume IPv6 is not working when getaddrinfo is not present.
  
  The check to see if IPv6 actually works is now independent of whether
  there is any resolver that can potentially resolve a hostname to IPv6.
  
  Prior to this change if getaddrinfo() was not found at compile time then
  Curl_ipv6works() would be defined as a macro that returns FALSE.
  
  When getaddrinfo is not found then libcurl is built with CURLRES_IPV4
  defined instead of CURLRES_IPV6, meaning that it cannot do IPv6 lookups
  in the traditional way. With this commit if libcurl is built with IPv6
  support (ENABLE_IPV6) but without getaddrinfo (CURLRES_IPV6), and the
  IPv6 stack is actually working, then it is possible for libcurl to
  resolve IPv6 addresses by using DoH.

- connect: fix wrong format specifier in connect error string
  
  0842175 (not in any release) used the wrong format specifier (long int)
  for timediff_t. On an OS such as Windows libcurl's timediff_t (usually
  64-bit) is bigger than long int (32-bit). In 32-bit Windows builds the
  upper 32-bits of the timediff_t were erroneously then used by the next
  format specifier. Usually since the timeout isn't larger than 32-bits
  this would result in null as a pointer to the string with the reason for
  the connection failing. On other OSes or maybe other compilers it could
  probably result in garbage values (ie crash on deref).
  
  Before:
  Failed to connect to localhost port 12345 after 1201 ms: (nil)

  docs: make the documentation for --etag-save match the program behaviour
  
  When using curl with the option `--etag-save` I expected it to save the
  ETag without its surrounding quotes, as stated by the documentation in
  the repository and by the generated man pages.
  
  My first endeavour was to fix the program, but while investigating the
  history of the relevant parts, I discovered that curl once saved the
  ETag without the quotes.  This was undone by Daniel Stenberg in commit
  `98c94596f5928840177b6bd3c7b0f0dd03a431af`, therefore I decided that in
  this case the documentation should be adjusted to match the behaviour of
  curl.
  
  The changed save behaviour also made parts of the `--etag-compare`
  documentation wrong or superfluous, so I adjusted those accordingly.

  Revert "ftp: Expression 'ftpc->wait_data_conn' is always false"
  
  The reverted commit introduced a logic error in code that was
  correct.
  
  The client using libcurl would notice the error since FTP file
  uploads in active transfer mode would somtimes complete with
  success despite no transfer having been performed and the
  "uploaded" file thus not being on the remote server afterwards.
  
  The FTP server would notice the error because it receives a
  RST on the data connection it has established with the client
  before any data was transferred at all.
  
  The logic error happens if the STOR response from the server have
  arrived by the time ftp_multi_statemach() in the affected code path
  is called, but the incoming data connection have not arrived yet.
  In that case, the processing of the STOR response will cause
  'ftpc->wait_data_conn' to be set to TRUE, contradicting the comment
  in the code. Since 'complete' will also be set, later logic would
  believe the transfer was done.
  
  In most cases, the STOR response will not have arrived yet when
  the affected code path is executed, or the incoming connection will
  also have arrived, and thus the error would not express itself.
  But if the speed difference of the device using libcurl and the
  FTP server is exactly right, the error may happen as often as in
  one out of hundred file transfers.

- vtls: fix warning due to function prototype mismatch
  
  b09c8ee changed the function prototype. Caught by Visual Studio.

- curl_multibyte: Remove local encoding fallbacks
  
  - If the UTF-8 to UTF-16 conversion fails in Windows Unicode builds then
    no longer fall back to assuming the string is in a local encoding.
  
  Background:
  
  Some functions in Windows Unicode builds must convert UTF-8 to UTF-16 to
  pass to the Windows CRT API wide-character functions since in Windows
  UTF-8 is not a valid locale (or at least 99% of the time right now).
  
  Prior to this change if the Unicode encoding conversion failed then
  libcurl would assume, for backwards compatibility with applications that
  may have written their code for non-Unicode builds, attempt to convert
  the string from local encoding to UTF-16.
  
  That type of "best effort" could theoretically cause some type of
  security or other problem if a string that was locally encoded was also
  valid UTF-8, and therefore an unexpected UTF-8 to UTF-16 conversion
  could occur.

- metalink: remove
  
  Warning: this will make existing curl command lines that use metalink to
  stop working.
  
  Reasons for removal:
  
  1. We've found several security problems and issues involving the
     metalink support in curl. The issues are not detailed here. When
     working on those, it become apparent to the team that several of the
     problems are due to the system design, metalink library API and what
     the metalink RFC says. They are very hard to fix on the curl side
     only.
  
  2. The metalink usage with curl was only very briefly documented and was
     not following the "normal" curl usage pattern in several ways, making
     it surprising and non-intuitive which could lead to further security
     issues.
  
  3. The metalink library was last updated 6 years ago and wasn't so
     active the years before that either. An unmaintained library means
     there's a security problem waiting to happen. This is probably reason
     enough.
  
  4. Metalink requires an XML parsing library, which is complex code (even
     the smaller alternatives) and to this day often gets security
     updates.
  
  5. Metalink is not a widely used curl feature. In the 2020 curl user
     survey, only 1.4% of the responders said that they'd are using it. In
     2021 that number was 1.2%. Searching the web also show very few
     traces of it being used, even with other tools.
  
  6. The torrent format and associated technology clearly won for
     downloading large files from multiple sources in parallel.

  cmake: Avoid leaking absolute paths into exported config
  
  The `find_libarary` command resolves the library or framework
  into an absolute path. In case of system frameworks which are
  located within an Xcode-provided SDK this results in the Xcode
  path and SDK version being part of the library path.
  
  Because those library paths end up in the exported CMake config
  importing curl will fail once the Xcode location or SDK version
  changes:
  
  ```cmake
  set_target_properties(CURL::libcurl PROPERTIES
    INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES "${_IMPORT_PREFIX}/include"
    INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES "lber;ldap;/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX11.3.sdk/System/Library/Frameworks/SystemConfiguration.framework;OpenSSL::SSL;OpenSSL::Crypto;ZLIB::ZLIB"
  )
  ```
  
  A work-around is to link against system-level frameworks with
  `-framework XYZ`. In case of `SystemConfiguration` we might be able
  to omit the lookup-check because we could assume the framework is
  always present.

  ares: always store IPv6 addresses first
  
  Trying dual-stack on some embedded platform, I noticed that quite
  frequently (20%) libCurl starts from IPv4 regardless the Happy Eyeballs
  timeout value.  After debugging this issue, I noticed that this happens
  if c-ares resolver response for IPv6 family comes before IPv4 (which was
  randomly happening in my tests).
  
  In such cases, because libCurl puts the last resolver response on top of
  the address list, when IPv4 resolver response comes after IPv6 one - the
  IPv4 family starts the connection phase instead of IPv6 family.
  
  The solution for this issue is to always put IPv6 addresses on top of
  the address list, regardless the order of resolver responses.

- ssl: read pending close notify alert before closing the connection
  
  This avoids a TCP reset (RST) if the server initiates a connection
  shutdown by sending an SSL close notify alert and then closes the TCP
  connection.
  
  For SSL connections, usually the server announces that it will close the
  connection with an SSL close notify alert. curl should read this alert.
  If curl does not read this alert and just closes the connection, some
  operating systems close the TCP connection with an RST flag.
  
  See RFC 1122, section 4.2.2.13
  
  If curl reads the close notify alert, the TCP connection is closed
  normally with a FIN flag.
  
  The new code is similar to existing code in the "SSL shutdown" function:
  try to read an alert (non-blocking), and ignore any read errors.

  CURLOPT_IPRESOLVE: preventing wrong IP version from being used
  
  In some situations, it was possible that a transfer was setup to
  use an specific IP version, but due do DNS caching or connection
  reuse, it ended up using a different IP version from requested.
  
  This commit changes the effect of CURLOPT_IPRESOLVE from simply
  restricting address resolution to preventing the wrong connection
  type being used, when choosing a connection from the pool, and
  to restricting what addresses could be used when establishing
  a new connection.
  
  It is important that all addresses versions are resolved, even if
  not used in that transfer in particular, because the result is
  cached, and could be useful for a different transfer with a
  different CURLOPT_IPRESOLVE setting.

  data_pending: check only SECONDARY socket for FTP(S) transfers
  
  Check the FIRST for all other protocols.
  
  This fixes a timeout in an ftps download. The server sends a TLS
  close_notify message in the same packet as the file data. The
  close_notify seems to not be handled in the schannel_recv function, so
  libcurl is not aware that the server has closed the connection. Thus
  libcurl ends up waiting for action on the socket until a timeout is
  reached. With the secondary socket check added to the data_pending
  function, the close_notify is properly handled, and the ftps transfer
  terminates as expected.

- gnutls: make setting only the MAX TLS allowed version work
  
  Previously, settting only the max allowed TLS version, leaving the
  minimum one at default, didn't actually set it and left it to default
  (TLS 1.3) too!
  
  As a bonus, this change also removes the dead code handling of SSLv3
  since that version can't be set anymore (since eff614fb0242cb).

  c-hyper: don't write to set.writeheader if null
  
  Previously if a caller set CURLOPT_WRITEFUNCTION but did not set a
  CURLOPT_HEADERDATA buffer, Hyper would still attempt to write headers to
  the data->set.writeheader header buffer, even though it is null.  This
  led to NPE segfaults attempting to use libcurl+Hyper with Git, for
  example.
  
  Instead, process the client write for the status line using the same
  logic we use to process the client write for the later HTTP headers,
  which contains the appropriate guard logic. As a side benefit,
  data->set.writeheader is now only read in one file instead of two.

  - New curl tool options --ssl-auto-client-cert and
    --proxy-ssl-auto-client-cert map to CURLSSLOPT_AUTO_CLIENT_CERT.
  
  This option is only supported for Schannel (the native Windows SSL
  library). Prior to this change Schannel would, with no notification to
  the client, attempt to locate a client certificate and send it to the
  server, when requested by the server. Since the server can request any
  certificate that supports client authentication in the OS certificate
  store it could be a privacy violation and unexpected.

  - Save a parallel transfer's result code only when it fails and the
    transfer is not being retried.
  
  Prior to this change the result code was always set which meant that a
  failed result could be erroneously discarded if a different transfer
  later had a successful result (CURLE_OK).

- urlapi: "normalize" numerical IPv4 host names
  
  When the host name in a URL is given as an IPv4 numerical address, the
  address can be specified with dotted numericals in four different ways:
  a32, a.b24, a.b.c16 or a.b.c.d and each part can be specified in
  decimal, octal (0-prefixed) or hexadecimal (0x-prefixed).
  
  Instead of passing on the name as-is and leaving the handling to the
  underlying name functions, which made them not work with c-ares but work
  with getaddrinfo, this change now makes the curl URL API itself detect
  and "normalize" host names specified as IPv4 numericals.
  
  The WHATWG URL Spec says this is an okay way to specify a host name in a
  URL. RFC 3896 does not allow them, but curl didn't prevent them before
  and it seems other RFC 3896-using tools have not either. Host names used
  like this are widely supported by other tools as well due to the
  handling being done by getaddrinfo and friends.
  
  I decided to add the functionality into the URL API itself so that all
  users of these functions get the benefits, when for example wanting to
  compare two URLs. Also, it makes curl built to use c-ares now support
  them as well and make curl builds more consistent.
  
  The normalization makes HTTPS and virtual hosted HTTP work fine even
  when curl gets the address specified using one of the "obscure" formats.
  
  Test 1560 is extended to verify.

  These SSL versions are typically not supported by the TLS libraries since a

  for them to be used will just cause an error to be returned slightly later.
  
  In the unlikely event that a user's TLS library actually still supports these
  protocol versions, this change might make the request a little less insecure.

  The code in cr_recv was returning prematurely as soon as the socket

  ntlm: fix negotiated flags usage
  
  According to Microsoft document MS-NLMP, current flags usage is not
  accurate: flag NTLMFLAG_NEGOTIATE_NTLM2_KEY controls the use of
  extended security in an NTLM authentication message and NTLM version 2
  cannot be negotiated within the protocol.
  
  The solution implemented here is: if the extended security flag is set,
  prefer using NTLM version 2 (as a server featuring extended security
  should also support version 2). If version 2 has been disabled at
  compile time, use extended security.
  
  Tests involving NTLM are adjusted to this new behavior.

  configure: include <time.h> unconditionally
  
  In 2682e5f5, several instances of AC_HEADER_TIME were removed since
  it is a deprecated autoconf macro. However, this was the macro that
  defined TIME_WITH_SYS_TIME, which was used to indicate that <time.h>
  can be included alongside <sys/time.h>. TIME_WITH_SYS_TIME is still
  used in the configure test body and since it is no longer defined,
  <time.h> is *not* included on systems that have <sys/time.h>.
  
  In particular, at least on musl libc and glibc, <sys/time.h> does
  not implicitly include <time.h> and does not declare clock_gettime,
  gmtime_r, or localtime_r. This causes configure to fail to detect
  those functions.
  
  The AC_HEADER_TIME macro deprecation text says
  
  > All current systems provide time.h; it need not be checked for.
  > Not all systems provide sys/time.h, but those that do, all allow
  > you to include it and time.h simultaneously.
  
  So, to fix this issue, simply include <time.h> unconditionally when
  testing for time-related functions and in libcurl, and don't bother
  checking for it.

  This is especially notable when a transfer first sits in PENDING, as

  rustls: allocate a buffer for TLS data.
  
  Previously, rustls was using an on-stack array for TLS data. However,

  rustls: support CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER
  
  This requires the latest main branch of crustls, which provides
  rustls_client_config_builder_dangerous_set_certificate_verifier and
  rustls_client_config_builder_set_enable_sni.
  
  This refactors the session setup into its own function, and adds a new
  function cr_hostname_is_ip. Because crustls doesn't support verification
  of IP addresses, special handling is needed: We disable SNI and set a
  placeholder hostname (which never actually gets sent on the wire).

- cookies: Fix potential NULL pointer deref with PSL
  
  Curl_cookie_init can be called with data being NULL, and this can in turn
  be passed to Curl_cookie_add, meaning that both functions must be careful
  to only use data where it's checked for being a NULL pointer.  The libpsl
  support code does however dereference data without checking, so if we are
  indeed having an unset data pointer we cannot PSL check the cookiedomain.
  
  This is currently not a reachable dereference, as the only caller with a
  NULL data isn't passing a file to initialize cookies from, but since the
  API has this contract let's ensure we hold it.

- schannel: Evaluate CURLOPT_SSL_OPTIONS via SSL_SET_OPTION macro
  
  - Change use of those options from CURLOPT_SSL_OPTIONS that are not
    already evaluated via SSL_SET_OPTION in schannel and secure transport
    to use that instead of data->set.ssl.optname.
  
  Example:
  
  Evaluate SSL_SET_OPTION(no_revoke) instead of data->set.ssl.no_revoke.
  
  This change is because options set via CURLOPT_SSL_OPTIONS
  (data->set.ssl.optname) are separate from those set for HTTPS proxy via
  CURLOPT_PROXY_SSL_OPTIONS (data->set.proxy_ssl.optname). The
  SSL_SET_OPTION macro determines whether the connection is for HTTPS
  proxy and based on that which option to evaluate.
  
  Since neither Schannel nor Secure Transport backends currently support
  HTTPS proxy in libcurl, this change is for posterity and has no other
  effect.

- projects: Update VS projects for OpenSSL 1.1.x
  
  - Update VS project templates to use the OpenSSL lib names and include
    directories for OpenSSL 1.1.x.
  
  This change means the VS project files will now build only with OpenSSL
  1.1.x when an OpenSSL configuration is chosen. Prior to this change the
  project files built only with OpenSSL 1.0.x (end-of-life) when an
  OpenSSL configuration was chosen.
  
  The template changes in this commit were made by script:
  
  libeay32.lib => libcrypto.lib
  ssleay32.lib => libssl.lib
  ..\..\..\..\..\openssl\inc32 => ..\..\..\..\..\openssl\include
  
  And since the output directory now contains the includes it's prepended:
  ..\..\..\..\..\openssl\build\Win{32,64}\VC{6..15}\{DLL,LIB}
  {Debug,Release}\include
  
  - Change build-openssl.bat to copy the build's include directory to the
    output directory (as seen above).
  
  Each build has its own opensslconf.h which is different so we can't just
  include the source include directory any longer.
  
  Note the include directory in the output directory is a full copy from
  the build so technically we don't need to include the OpenSSL source
  include directory in the template. However, I left it last in case the
  user made a custom OpenSSL build using the old method which would put
  opensslconf in the OpenSSL source include directory.
  
  - Change build-openssl.bat to use a temporary install directory that is
    different from the temporary build directory.
  
  For OpenSSL 1.1.x the temporary paths must be separate not a descendant
  of the other, otherwise pdb files will be lost between builds.
