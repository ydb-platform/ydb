 * \details H5Pset_fapl_core() modifies the file access property list to use the
 *          #H5FD_CORE driver.
 *
 *          The #H5FD_CORE driver enables an application to work with a file in
 *          memory, speeding reads and writes as no disk access is made. File
 *          contents are stored only in memory until the file is closed. The \p
 *          backing_store parameter determines whether file contents are ever
 *          written to disk.
 *
 *          \p increment specifies the increment by which allocated memory is to
 *          be increased each time more memory is required.
 *
 *          While using H5Fcreate() to create a core file, if the \p
 *          backing_store is set to 1 (true), the file contents are flushed to a
 *          file with the same name as this core file when the file is closed or
 *          access to the file is terminated in memory.
 *
 *          The application is allowed to open an existing file with #H5FD_CORE
 *          driver. While using H5Fopen() to open an existing file, if the \p
 *          backing_store is set to 1 (true) and the \c flags for H5Fopen() is set to
 *          #H5F_ACC_RDWR, any change to the file contents are saved to the file
 *          when the file is closed. If \p backing_store is set to 0 (false) and the \c
 *          flags for H5Fopen() is set to #H5F_ACC_RDWR, any change to the file
 *          contents will be lost when the file is closed. If the flags for
 *          H5Fopen() is set to #H5F_ACC_RDONLY, no change to the file is
 *          allowed either in memory or on file.
 *
 * \note Currently this driver cannot create or open family or multi files.
 *
 * \since 1.4.0
