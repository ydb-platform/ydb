 * \details H5Pset_fapl_direct() sets the file access property list, \p fapl_id,
 *          to use the direct I/O driver, #H5FD_DIRECT. With this driver, data
 *          is written to or read from the file synchronously without being
 *          cached by the system.
 *
 *          File systems usually require the data address in memory, the file
 *          address, and the size of the data to be aligned. The HDF5 library's
 *          direct I/O driver is able to handle unaligned data, though that will
 *          consume some additional memory resources and may slow
 *          performance. To get better performance, use the system function \p
 *          posix_memalign to align the data buffer in memory and the HDF5
 *          function H5Pset_alignment() to align the data in the file. Be aware,
 *          however, that aligned data I/O may cause the HDF5 file to be bigger
 *          than the actual data size would otherwise require because the
 *          alignment may leave some holes in the file.
 *
 *          \p alignment specifies the required alignment boundary in memory.
 *
 *          \p block_size specifies the file system block size. A value of 0
 *          (zero) means to use HDF5 library's default value of 4KB.
 *
 *          \p cbuf_size specifies the copy buffer size.
 *
 * \since 1.8.0
