 *          accomplished as an atomic operation.
 *
 *          \p src_loc and \p src_name identify the original link.
 *          \p src_loc is the original location identifier; \p src_name is
 *          the path to the link and is interpreted relative to \p src_loc.
 *
 *          \p dst_loc and \p dst_name identify the new link. \p dst_loc is
 *          either a file or group identifier; \p dst_name is the path to
 *          the link and is interpreted relative to \p dst_loc.
 *
 *          \p lcpl_id and \p lapl_id are the link creation and link access
 *          property lists, respectively, associated with the new link,
 *          \p dst_name.
 *
 *          Through these property lists, several properties are available to
 *          govern the behavior of H5Lmove(). The property controlling creation
 *          of missing intermediate groups is set in the link creation property
 *          list with H5Pset_create_intermediate_group(); H5Lmove() ignores any
 *          other properties in the link creation property list. Properties
 *          controlling character encoding, link traversals, and external link
 *          prefixes are set in the link access property list with
 *          H5Pset_char_encoding(), H5Pset_nlinks(), and H5Pset_elink_prefix(),
 *          respectively.
 *
 * \note Note that H5Lmove() does not modify the value of the link; the new

 *          buffer.
 *
 *          \p size is the size of \p buf and should be the size of the link

 *
 *          In the case of external links, the target file and object names are

 * \details H5Lexists() allows an application to determine whether the link \p
 *          name exists in the location specified by \p loc_id. The link may be
 *          of any type; only the presence of a link with that name is checked.
 *
 *          Note that H5Lexists() verifies only that the target link exists. If
 *          name includes either a relative path or an absolute path to the
 *          target link, intermediate steps along the path must be verified

 *          the path is not verified, and an intermediate element of the path
 *          does not exist, H5Lexists() will fail. The example in the next
 *          paragraph illustrates one step-by-step method for verifying the
 *          existence of a link with a relative or absolute path.
 *
 *          \Bold{Example:} Use the following steps to verify the existence of
 *          the link \c datasetD in the \c group group1/group2/softlink_to_group3/,
 *          where \c group1 is a member of the group specified by \c loc_id:
 *
 *          1. First, use H5Lexists() to verify that the \c group1 exists.
 *          2. If \c group1 exists, use H5Lexists() again, this time with name
 *             set to \c group1/group2, to verify that \c group2 exists.
 *          3. If \c group2 exists, use H5Lexists() with name set to
 *             \c group1/group2/softlink_to_group3 to verify that
 *             \c softlink_to_group3 exists.
 *          4. If \c softlink_to_group3 exists, you can now safely use
 *             H5Lexists() with \c name set to
 *             \c group1/group2/softlink_to_group3/datasetD to verify that the
 *             target link, \c datasetD, exists.
 *
 *          If the link to be verified is specified with an absolute path, the
 *          same approach should be used, but starting with the first link in
 *          the file's root group. For instance, if \c datasetD were in
 *          \c /group1/group2/softlink_to_group3, the first call to H5Lexists()
 *          would have name set to \c /group1.
 *
 *          Note that this is an outline and does not include all the necessary
 *          details. Depending on circumstances, for example, you may need to
 *          verify that an intermediate link points to a group and that a soft
 *          link points to an existing target.
 *
 * \note The behavior of H5Lexists() was changed in the 1.10 release in the
 *       case where the root group, \c "/", is the name of the link. This
 *       change is described below:
 *       <ol>
 *       <li>Let \c file denote a valid HDF5 file identifier, and let \c lapl
 *          denote a valid link access property list identifier. A call to
 *          H5Lexists() with arguments \c file, \c "/", and \c lapl
 *          returns a positive value; in other words,
 *          \Code{H5Lexists(file, "/", lapl)} returns a positive value.
 *          In the HDF5 1.8 release, this function returns 0.</li>
 *       <li>Let \c root denote a valid HDF5 group identifier that refers to the
 *          root group of an HDF5 file, and let \c lapl denote a valid link
 *          access property list identifier. A call to H5Lexists() with
 *          arguments c root, \c "/", and \c lapl returns a positive value;
 *          in other words, \Code{H5Lexists(root, "/", lapl)} returns a positive
 *          value. In the HDF5 1.8 release, this function returns 0.</li>
 *       </ol>
 *       Note that the function accepts link names and path names. This is
 *       potentially misleading to callers, and we plan to separate the
 *       functionality for link names and path names in a future release.
 *
 * \attention H5Lexists() checks the existence of only the final element in a
 *            relative or absolute path; it does not check any other path
 *            elements. The function will therefore fail when both of the
 *            following conditions exist:
 *            - \c name is not local to the group specified by \c loc_id or,
 *              if \c loc_id is something other than a group identifier, \c name
 *              is not local to the root group.
 *            - Any element of the relative path or absolute path in name,
 *              except the target link, does not exist.
 *
 * \version 1.10.0 Function behavior changed in this release. (See the note.)

 *
 *          The possible return values from the callback function, and the

 *          \li Zero causes the visit iterator to continue, returning zero when
 *              all group members have been processed.
 *          \li  A positive value causes the visit iterator to immediately
 *               return that positive value, indicating short-circuit success.

 *
 *          \p file_name identifies the target file containing the target
 *          object; \p obj_name specifies the path of the target object within
 *          that file. \p obj_name must be an absolute pathname in
 *          \p file_name, i.e., it must start at the target file's root group,
 *          but it is not interpreted until an application attempts to traverse
 *          it.
 *
 *          \p link_loc_id and \p link_name specify the location and name,
 *          respectively, of the new link. \p link_name is interpreted relative
 *          to \p link_loc_id.
 *
 *          \p lcpl_id is the link creation property list used in creating the
 *          new link.
 *
 *          \p lapl_id is the link access property list used in traversing the
 *          new link. Note that an external file opened by the traversal of an
 *          external link is always opened with the weak file close degree
 *          property setting, #H5F_CLOSE_WEAK (see H5Pset_fclose_degree());
 *          any file close degree property setting in \p lapl_id is ignored.
 *
 *          An external link behaves similarly to a soft link, and like a soft
 *          link in an HDF5 file, it may dangle: the target file and object
 *          need not exist at the time that the external link is created.
 *
 *          When the external link \p link_name is accessed, the library will
 *          search for the target file \p file_name as described below:
 *
 *          - If \p file_name is a relative pathname, the following steps are
 *            performed:
 *            - The library will get the prefix(es) set in the environment
 *              variable \c HDF5_EXT_PREFIX and will try to prepend each prefix
 *              to \p file_name to form a new \p file_name.
 *            - If the new \p file_name does not exist or if \c HDF5_EXT_PREFIX
 *              is not set, the library will get the prefix set via
 *              H5Pset_elink_prefix() and prepend it to \p file_name to form a
 *              new \p file_name.
 *            - If the new \p file_name does not exist or no prefix is being
 *              set by H5Pset_elink_prefix(), then the path of the file
 *              associated with \p link_loc_id is obtained. This path can be
 *              the absolute path or the current working directory plus the
 *              relative path of that file when it is created/opened. The
 *              library will prepend this path to \p file_name to form a new
 *              \p file_name.
 *            - If the new \p file_name does not exist, then the library will
 *              look for \p file_name and will return failure/success
 *              accordingly.
 *          - If \p file_name is an absolute pathname, the library will first
 *            try to find \p file_name. If \p file_name does not exist,
 *            \p file_name is stripped of directory paths to form a new
 *            \p file_name. The search for the new \p file_name then follows
 *            the same steps as described above for a relative pathname. See
 *            examples below illustrating how target_file_name is stripped to
 *            form a new \p file_name.
 *
 *          Note that \p file_name is considered to be an absolute pathname
 *          when the following condition is true:
 *
 *          - For Unix, the first character of \p file_name is a slash (\c /).
 *            For example, consider a \p file_name of \c /tmp/A.h5.
 *            If that target file does not exist, the new \p file_name after
 *            stripping will be \c A.h5.
 *          - For Windows, there are 6 cases:
 *            -# \p file_name is an absolute drive with an absolute pathname.
 *               For example, consider a \p file_name of \c /tmp/A.h5. If that
 *               target file does not exist, the new \p file_name after
 *               stripping will be \c A.h5.
 *            -# \p file_name is an absolute pathname without specifying drive
 *               name. For example, consider a \p file_name of \c /tmp/A.h5.
 *               If that target file does not exist, the new \p file_name after
 *               stripping will be \c A.h5.
 *            -# \p file_name is an absolute drive with a relative pathname.
 *               For example, consider a \p file_name of \c /tmp/A.h5. If that
 *               target file does not exist, the new \p file_name after
 *               stripping will be \c tmp\A.h5.
 *            -# \p file_name is in UNC (Uniform Naming Convention) format with
 *               a server name, share name, and pathname. For example, consider
 *               a \p file_name of \c /tmp/A.h5. If that target file does not
 *               exist, the new \p file_name after stripping will be \c A.h5.
 *            -# \p file_name is in Long UNC (Uniform Naming Convention) format
 *               with a server name, share name, and pathname. For example,
 *               consider a \p file_name of \c /tmp/A.h5. If that target file
 *               does not exist, the new \p file_name after stripping will be
 *               \c A.h5.
 *            -# \p file_name is in Long UNC (Uniform Naming Convention) format
 *               with an absolute drive and an absolute pathname. For example,
 *               consider a \p file_name of \c /tmp/A.h5. If that target file
 *               does not exist, the new \p file_name after stripping will be
 *               \c A.h5.
 *
 *          The library opens the target file \p file_name with the file access
 *          property list that is set via H5Pset_elink_fapl() when the external
 *          link link_name is accessed. If no such property list is set, the
 *          library uses the file access property list associated with the file
 *          of \p link_loc_id to open the target file.
 *
 *          If an application requires additional control over file access
 *          flags or the file access property list, see H5Pset_elink_cb(); this
 *          function enables the use of an external link callback function as
 *          described in H5L_elink_traverse_t().
 *
 * \attention A file close degree property setting (H5Pset_fclose_degree()) in
 *            the external link file access property list or in the external
 *            link callback function will be ignored. A file opened by means of
 *            traversing an external link is always opened with the weak file
 *            close degree property setting, #H5F_CLOSE_WEAK .

 *
 *          The location identifier, \p loc_id, specifies the location of the
 *          link. A link name, \p name, interpreted relative to \p loc_id,
 *          specifies the link being queried.
 *
 *          \p lapl_id is the link access property list associated with the

 *          An example of a situation that requires a non-default link access

 *

 *          There will be additional valid values if user-defined links have
 *          been registered.
 *
 *          \c corder specifies the link's creation order position while
 *          \c corder_valid indicates whether the value in \c corder is valid.
 *
 *          If \c corder_valid is \c true, the value in \c corder is known to
 *          be valid; if \c corder_valid is \c false, the value in \c corder is
 *          presumed to be invalid;
 *
 *          \c corder starts at zero (0) and is incremented by one (1) as new
 *          links are created. But higher-numbered entries are not adjusted
 *          when a lower-numbered link is deleted; the deleted link's creation
 *          order position is simply left vacant. In such situations, the value
 *          of \c corder for the last link created will be larger than the
 *          number of links remaining in the group.
 *
 *          \c cset specifies the character set in which the link name is
 *          encoded. Valid values include the following:
 *          \csets
 *          This value is set with #H5Pset_char_encoding.
 *
 *          \c address and \c val_size are returned for hard and symbolic
 *          links, respectively. Symbolic links include soft and external links
 *          and some user-defined links.
 *
 *          If the link is a hard link, \c address specifies the file address
 *          that the link points to.
 *
 *          If the link is a symbolic link, \c val_size will be the length of

 *          - \p n specifies the position of the subject link. Note that this
 *            count is zero-based; 0 (zero) indicates that the function will
 *            return the value of the first link; if \p n is 5, the function
 *            will return the value of the sixth link; etc.
 *
 *          For example, assume that \p idx_type, \p order, and \p n are
 *          #H5_INDEX_NAME, #H5_ITER_DEC, and 5, respectively. #H5_INDEX_NAME
 *          indicates that the links are accessed in lexicographic order by

 *          group or file identifier, \p group_id.
 *
 *          Two parameters are used to establish the iteration: \p idx_type and
 *          \p order.
 *
 *          \p idx_type specifies the index to be used. If the links have not
 *          been indexed by the index type, they will first be sorted by that
 *          index then the iteration will begin; if the links have been so
 *          indexed, the sorting step will be unnecessary, so the iteration may
 *          begin more quickly. Valid values include the following:
 *          \indexes
 *
 *          Note that the index type passed in \p idx_type is a best effort
 *          setting. If the application passes in a value indicating iteration
 *          in creation order and a group is encountered that was not tracked
 *          in creation order, that group will be iterated over in
 *          lexicographic order by name, or name order. (Name order is the
 *          native order used by the HDF5 library and is always available.)
 *
 *          \p order specifies the order in which objects are to be inspected
 *          along the index specified in \p idx_type. Valid values include the
 *          following:
 *          \orders
 *
 *          \p op is a callback function of type \ref H5L_iterate1_t that is invoked
 *          for each link encountered.
 *          \snippet this H5L_iterate1_t_snip
 *
 *          The \ref H5L_info1_t struct is defined (in H5Lpublic.h) as follows:
 *          \snippet this H5L_info1_t_snip
 *
 *          The possible return values from the callback function, and the
 *          effect of each, are as follows:
 *          \li Zero causes the visit iterator to continue, returning zero when
 *              all group members have been processed.
 *          \li  A positive value causes the visit iterator to immediately
 *               return that positive value, indicating short-circuit success.
 *          \li A negative value causes the visit iterator to immediately
 *              return that value, indicating failure.
 *
 *          The H5Lvisit1() \p op_data parameter is a user-defined pointer to
 *          the data required to process links in the course of the iteration.
 *          This pointer is passed back to each step of the iteration in the
 *          \p op callback function's \p op_data parameter.
 *
 *          H5Lvisit1() and H5Ovisit1() are companion functions: one for
 *          examining and operating on links; the other for examining and
 *          operating on the objects that those links point to. Both functions
 *          ensure that by the time the function completes successfully, every
 *          link or object below the specified point in the file has been
 *          presented to the application for whatever processing the
 *          application requires.
 *
 * \version 1.12.0 Function was renamed from H5Lvisit() to H5Lvisit1() and
 *                 deprecated.
 *
 * \since 1.8.0

 * \deprecated As of HDF5-1.12 this function has been deprecated in favor of

 *
 * \details H5Lvisit_by_name1() is a recursive iteration function to visit all
 *          links in and below a group in an HDF5 file, thus providing a
 *          mechanism for an application to perform a common set of operations
 *          across all of those links or a dynamically selected subset. For
 *          non-recursive iteration across the members of a group, see
 *          H5Literate1().
 *
 *          The group serving as the root of the iteration is specified by the
 *          \p loc_id / \p group_name parameter pair. \p loc_id specifies a
 *          file or group; group_name specifies either a group in the file
 *          (with an absolute name based in the file's root group) or a group
 *          relative to \p loc_id. If \p loc_id fully specifies the group that
 *          is to serve as the root of the iteration, group_name should be '.'
 *          (a dot). (Note that when \p loc_id fully specifies the group
 *          that is to serve as the root of the iteration, the user may wish to
 *          consider using H5Lvisit1() instead of H5Lvisit_by_name1().)
 *
 *          Two parameters are used to establish the iteration: \p idx_type and
 *          \p order.
 *
 *          \p idx_type specifies the index to be used. If the links have not
 *          been indexed by the index type, they will first be sorted by that
 *          index then the iteration will begin; if the links have been so
 *          indexed, the sorting step will be unnecessary, so the iteration may
 *          begin more quickly. Valid values include the following:
 *          \indexes
 *
 *          Note that the index type passed in \p idx_type is a best effort
 *          setting. If the application passes in a value indicating iteration
 *          in creation order and a group is encountered that was not tracked
 *          in creation order, that group will be iterated over in
 *          lexicographic order by name, or name order. (Name order is the
 *          native order used by the HDF5 library and is always available.)
 *
 *          \p order specifies the order in which objects are to be inspected
 *          along the index specified in \p idx_type. Valid values include the
 *          following:
 *          \orders
 *
 *          The \p op callback function, the related \ref H5L_info1_t
 *          \c struct, and the effect that the callback function's return value
 *          has on the application are described in H5Lvisit1().
 *
 *          The H5Lvisit_by_name1() \p op_data parameter is a user-defined
 *          pointer to the data required to process links in the course of the
 *          iteration. This pointer is passed back to each step of the
 *          iteration in the callback function's \p op_data parameter.
 *
 *          \p lapl_id is a link access property list. In the general case,
 *          when default link access properties are acceptable, this can be
 *          passed in as #H5P_DEFAULT. An example of a situation that requires
 *          a non-default link access property list is when the link is an
 *          external link; an external link may require that a link prefix be
 *          set in a link access property list (see H5Pset_elink_prefix()).
 *
 *          H5Lvisit_by_name1() and H5Ovisit_by_name1() are companion
 *          functions: one for examining and operating on links; the other for
 *          examining and operating on the objects that those links point to.
 *          Both functions ensure that by the time the function completes
 *          successfully, every link or object below the specified point in the
 *          file has been presented to the application for whatever processing
 *          the application requires.
