 *          a 1-dimensional array and a selection of 3 points in a
 *          4-dimensional array.
 *
 *          In the 1D case, we will be selecting five points and a 1D
 *          dataspace has rank 1, so the selection will be described in a
 *          5-by-1 array. To select the 1st, 14th, 17th, 23rd and 8th elements
 *          of the dataset, the selection array would be as follows
 *          (remembering that point coordinates are zero-based):
 *          \n      0
 *          \n     13
 *          \n     16

 *
 *          This point selection array will be serialized in the \p coord
 *          buffer as:
 *          \n      0 13 16 22 7
 *
 *          In the 4D case, we will be selecting three points and a 4D
 *          dataspace has rank 4, so the selection will be described in a
 *          3-by-4 array. To select the points (1,1,1,1), (14,6,12,18), and
 *          (8,22,30,22), the point selection array would be as follows:
 *          \n      0  0  0  0
 *          \n     13  5 11 17

 *          each value in the \p stride array determining how many elements to
 *          move in each dimension. Setting a value in the \p stride array to

 *          The \p count array determines how many blocks to select from the
