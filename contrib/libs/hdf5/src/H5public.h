 *          be allocated, 1Mb for each of the regular, array, block, and
 *          factory type lists.
 *
 *          The settings specified for block free lists are duplicated for

 *          free lists by x bytes will increase the potential free list memory
 *          usage by 2x bytes.
 *
 *          Using a value of -1 for a limit means that no limit is set for the

 *          HDF5 Release \Code{\<majnum\>.\<minnum\>.\<relnum\>}\n

 *          precaution is taken to avoid the risks of data corruption or
 *          segmentation faults.
 *

 *          compiled with one version of HDF5 and is dynamically linked with a
 *          different version different version.
 *
 *          If the above test passes, H5check_version() proceeds to verify the
 *          consistency of additional library version information. This is
 *          designed to catch source code inconsistencies that do not normally
 *          cause failures; if this check reveals an inconsistency, an
