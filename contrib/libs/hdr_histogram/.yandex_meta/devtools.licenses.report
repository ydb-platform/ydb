# Available actions:
# keep - keep license in contrib and use in credits
# skip - skip license

# {all file action} records will be generated when license text contains filename that exists on filesystem (in contrib directory)
# We suppose that that files can contain some license info
# Available all file actions:
# FILE_IGNORE - ignore file (do nothing)
# FILE_INCLUDE - include all file data into licenses text file
