Libidn README -- Important introductory notes.
Copyright (C) 2002-2024 Simon Josefsson
See the end for copying conditions.

Libidn is a package for internationalized string handling based on the
Stringprep, Punycode, IDNA2003 and TLD specifications.  Libidn is a
GNU project.  See the file COPYING for licensing information.

The IDNA2003 specifications have been superseded by IDNA2008 which is
implemented by Libidn2 <https://www.gnu.org/software/libidn/#libidn2>,
and the only reasonable use of the libidn library today is to support
the historic IDNA2003 behaviour or to use Stringprep profiles.  Please
try to migrate to libidn2 wherever possible.

If you obtained this file as part of a "git clone", then see the
CONTRIBUTING.md file.  If this file came to you as part of a tar
archive, then see the file INSTALL for compilation and installation
instructions.

If you need help to use Libidn, or wish to help others, you are
