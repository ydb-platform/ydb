/* Written by Paul Eggert.  */

/* Provide public ATTRIBUTE_* names for the private _GL_ATTRIBUTE_*
   macros used within Gnulib.  */

/* The placement of these attributes depends on the kind of declaration
   and, in some cases, also on the programming language (C vs. C++).

   In function declarations and function definitions:

     * ATTRIBUTE_NOTHROW must come after the parameter list.

     * The macros
         ATTRIBUTE_CONST
         ATTRIBUTE_PURE
         DEPRECATED
         MAYBE_UNUSED
         NODISCARD
         REPRODUCIBLE
         UNSEQUENCED
       must come before the return type, and more precisely:
         - In a function declaration/definition without a storage-class
           specifier: at the beginning of the declaration/definition.
         - In a function declaration/definition with a storage-class
           specifier:
             - In C: before the storage-class specifier.
             - In C++: between the storage-class specifier and the return type.

     * The other macros can be placed
         - Either
             - In a function declaration/definition without a storage-class
               specifier: at the beginning of the declaration/definition.
             - In a function declaration/definition with a storage-class
               specifier: between the storage-class specifier and the return
               type.
        - Or after the parameter list,
          âˆ™ but after ATTRIBUTE_NOTHROW if present.

   In other declarations, such as variable declarations:

     * Either
         - In C: before the storage-class specifier.
         - In C++: between the storage-class specifier and the return type.
       Then they apply to all entities that are declared by the declaration.

     * Or immediately after the name of an entity being declared by the
       declaration.  Then they apply to that entity only.
