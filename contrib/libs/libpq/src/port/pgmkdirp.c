 * pg_mkdir_p --- create a directory and, if necessary, parent directories
 *
 * This is equivalent to "mkdir -p" except we don't complain if the target
 * directory already exists.
 *
 * We assume the path is in canonical form, i.e., uses / as the separator.
 *
 * omode is the file permissions bits for the target directory.  Note that any
 * parent directories that have to be created get permissions according to the
 * prevailing umask, but with u+wx forced on to ensure we can create there.
 * (We declare omode as int, not mode_t, to minimize dependencies for port.h.)
 *
 * Returns 0 on success, -1 (with errno set) on failure.
 *
 * Note that on failure, the path arg has been modified to show the particular
 * directory level we had problems with.
