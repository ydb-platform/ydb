 *
 * NOTE: Although the delay is specified in microseconds, older Unixen and
 * Windows use periodic kernel ticks to wake up, which might increase the delay
 * time significantly.  We've observed delay increases as large as 20
 * milliseconds on supported platforms.
 *
 * On machines where "long" is 32 bits, the maximum delay is ~2000 seconds.
 *
 * CAUTION: It's not a good idea to use long sleeps in the backend.  They will
 * silently return early if a signal is caught, but that doesn't include
 * latches being set on most OSes, and even signal handlers that set MyLatch
 * might happen to run before the sleep begins, allowing the full delay.
 * Better practice is to use WaitLatch() with a timeout, so that backends
 * respond to latches and signals promptly.
