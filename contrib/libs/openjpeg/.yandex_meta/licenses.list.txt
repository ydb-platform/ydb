Anyone. As the OpenJPEG code is released under the [BSD 2-clause "Simplified" License][link-license], anyone can use or modify the code, even for commercial applications. The only restriction is to retain the copyright in the sources or in the binaries documentation. Of course, if you modified the code in a way that might be of interest for other users, you are encouraged to share it (through a [github pull request](https://github.com/uclouvain/openjpeg/pulls) or by filling an [issue](https://github.com/uclouvain/openjpeg/issues)) but this is not a requirement.
