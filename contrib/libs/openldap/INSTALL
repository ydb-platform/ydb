Making and Installing the OpenLDAP Distribution
===============================================

This file provides brief instructions on how to build and install
OpenLDAP on UNIX (and UNIX-like) systems.  More detailed information
and instructions can be found in The OpenLDAP Administrator's Guide
(available from http://www.openldap.org/doc/).

It is recommended that you read, or at least skim through, ALL of the
instructions in this file before attempting to build the software.

Making and Installing the OpenLDAP Distribution
-----------------------------------------------

1.   Unpack the distribution and change directory:

        % tar xfz openldap-VERSION.tgz
        % cd openldap-VERSION

     (replacing VERSION with the appropriate version string).  If you
     are reading this file, you probably have already done this!

2.   Type:

        % ./configure --help

     to list available configuration options.

     The configure script also looks for compiler/linker options on
     the command line and in the environment.  These include:

        Variable        Description     Example
        CC              C compiler      gcc
        CFLAGS          C flags         -O -g
        CPPFLAGS        cpp flags       -I/path/include -D__FOO__=42
        LDFLAGS         ld flags        -L/usr/local/lib
        LIBS            libraries       -llib
        PATH            command path    /usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin

     See doc/install/configure for generic configure documentation.

3.   Configure the build system:

        % ./configure [options] [var=value ...]

     If all goes well, the configure script will automatically detect
     the appropriate settings.  If the configure script fails, you
     should read the config.log file that it generated to see what it
     was trying to do and exactly what failed.  You may need to
     specify additional options and/or variables besides those listed
     above to obtain desired results, depending on your operating
     system.

4.   Build dependencies:

        % make depend

5.   Build the system:

        % make

     If all goes well, the system will build as configured.  If not,
     return to step 3 after reviewing the configuration settings.

6.   Test the standalone system:

     This step requires the standalone LDAP server, slapd(8), with MDB
     support.

        % make test

     If all goes well, the system has been built as configured.  If
     not, return to step 2 after reviewing your configuration
     settings.

7.   Install the software.  You may need to become the super-user
     (e.g. root) to do this (depending on where you are installing
     things):

        % su root -c 'make install'

8.   That's it.  Enjoy!

See the OpenLDAP Administrator's Guide and the manual pages for the
individual applications for configuration and use information. You may
also want to edit the configuration files used by the various
components.  These configuration files are located in the OpenLDAP
configuration directory (normally /usr/local/etc/openldap).

        ldap.conf               client defaults
        slapd.conf              Standalone LDAP daemon
        lload.conf              LDAP Load Balancer daemon
        schema/*.schema         Schema Definitions
