  defined in <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5789.html">RFC5789</a>. <p> If the HTTP
  request method is not known to instrumentation, it MUST set the @code http.request.method @endcode
  attribute to @code _OTHER @endcode. <p> If the HTTP instrumentation could end up converting valid
  HTTP request methods to @code _OTHER @endcode, then it MUST provide a way to override the list of
  known HTTP methods. If this override is done via environment variable, then the environment
  variable MUST be named OTEL_INSTRUMENTATION_HTTP_KNOWN_METHODS and support a comma-separated list
  of case-sensitive known HTTP methods (this list MUST be a full override of the default known
  method, it is not a list of known methods in addition to the defaults). <p> HTTP method names are
  case-sensitive and @code http.request.method @endcode attribute value MUST match a known HTTP
  method name exactly. Instrumentations for specific web frameworks that consider HTTP methods to be
  case insensitive, SHOULD populate a canonical equivalent. Tracing instrumentations that do so,
  MUST also set @code http.request.method_original @endcode to the original value.
