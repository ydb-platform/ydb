	  Updated config to the latest GNU snapshot.

2011-09-01  Alexey Melnikov <alexey.melnikov@isode.com>

	  further SASL authentication attempts from working.

2011-09-01  Alexey Melnikov <alexey.melnikov@isode.com>
	* lib/server.c: Fixed some aspects of mech_avail callback handling

2011-09-01  Alexey Melnikov <alexey.melnikov@isode.com>
	* include/md5.h, include/sasl.h, include/saslplug.h, lib/auxprop.c,

	  utils/pluginviewer.c, utils/sasldblistusers.c, utils/saslpasswd.c,
	  utils/testsuite.c: Many of the SASL includes define function pointers
	  without specifying arguments. In C, the () is treated as unspecified,
	  rather than (void), hence this is technically not a prototype,
	  and gcc warns about it. (Patch by Dave Cridland and Alexey Melnikov)

2011-09-01  Alexey Melnikov <alexey.melnikov@isode.com>
	* lib/server.c: Better server plugin API mismatch reporting

2011-05-23  Alexey Melnikov <alexey.melnikov@isode.com>
	* plugins/gs2.c, plugins/gs2_token.c, plugins/gs2_token.h,

	  Negative SASL errors are fatal. (Patch from Luke Howard.)

2011-05-13  Ken Murchison <murch@andrew.cmu.edu>
	* include/sasl.h, plugins/digest-md5.c:
	  Allow for non-persistent connections when using DIGEST-MD5 plugin
	  for server-side HTTP Digest (RFC 2617).  Also make sure that an
	  HTTP request is handed to plugin when required.

2011-04-19  Alexey Melnikov <alexey.melnikov@isode.com>
	* plugins/gssapi.c: Fix to build GSSAPI with Heimdal (patch from
	  Russ Allbery from Debian)

	  (patch by Dan White)

2011-04-13  Alexey Melnikov <alexey.melnikov@isode.com>
	* cmulocal/sasl2.m4: Only enable GS2 plugin if
	  gss_inquire_mech_for_saslname is defined in gssapi.h

2011-04-12  Alexey Melnikov <alexey.melnikov@isode.com>
	* plugins/Makefile.am, plugins/makeinit.sh, plugins/ldapdb.c:
	  LDAPDB build fixes from Dan White

2011-04-05  Alexey Melnikov <alexey.melnikov@isode.com>
	* configure.in, plugins/Makefile.am, plugins/NTMakefile,
	  plugins/makeinit.sh, lib/staticopen.h, win32/include/config.h:
	  Enabled SCRAM plugin build

2011-03-25  Alexey Melnikov <alexey.melnikov@isode.com>
	* plugins/Makefile.am, plugins/makeinit.sh, plugins/gs2_token.h,
	  plugins/gs2_token.c, README.GS2, cmulocal/sasl2.m4: GS2 plugin
	  from Luke Howard

2011-01-25  Ken Murchison <murch@andrew.cmu.edu>
	* include/sasl.h, include/saslplug.h, lib/client.c, lib/common.c,
	  plugins/digest-md5.c sample/http_digest_client.c:
	  Allow DIGEST-MD5 plugin to be used for client-side 
	  HTTP Digest (RFC 2617)

2011-01-21  Alexey Melnikov <alexey.melnikov@isode.com>
	* plugins/scram.c: Added support for channel bindings to SCRAM-SHA-1.

2011-01-21  Alexey Melnikov <alexey.melnikov@isode.com>
	* lib/client.c, lib/server.c, lib/common.c, lib/saslint.h: Fixed libsasl
	  to accept *-PLUS SASL mechanism names in client_mech_list/mech_list
	  options. As *-PLUS mechanism names were synthesized and didn't
	  correspond to real plugin names, setting client_mech_list to
	  "SCRAM-SHA-1-PLUS" (for example) was resulting in authentication
	  failure due to inability to find a matching SASL plugin.

2011-01-21  Alexey Melnikov <alexey.melnikov@isode.com>
	* include/saslplug.h, lib/client.c: Fixed handling of channel bindings
	  on the client side. The client side was failing to select a suitable
	  SASL mechanism when the application specified channel bindings, but
	  didn't make them mandatory to use. In such a configuration, if a
	  non channel binding capable mechanism was selected through
	  "client_mech_list" SASL option, sasl_client_start would fail.
	  For example if the server supports both SCRAM-SHA-1[-PLUS] and
	  PLAIN and "client_mech_list" was set to "PLAIN", authentication
	  would never work.

2011-01-21  Alexey Melnikov <alexey.melnikov@isode.com>
	* lib/client.c, lib/server.c: Better default ordering of SASL mechanisms.
	  Ordering by plugins max_ssf produces wrong result in case an application
	  using SASL doesn't care about SASL security layers. Before this change
	  DIGEST-MD5 was always preferred over SCRAM-SHA-1[-PLUS]. In particular
	  this change takes support for channel bindings into considerations.

2011-01-19  Ken Murchison <murch@andrew.cmu.edu>
	* include/sasl.h, include/saslplug.h,
	  lib/common.c, lib/server.c, plugins/digest-md5.c:
	  Changed server-side of HTTP Digest so that the application
	  must pass an HTTP Request structure (Method/URI/Entity-Body)
	  rather than just the HTTP Method

2011-01-19  Alexey Melnikov <alexey.melnikov@isode.com>
	* lib/server.c: Server side SASL context should list *-PLUS SASL
	  mechanisms before the corresponding non-PLUS mechanisms for naive
	  SASL clients.

2011-01-19  Alexey Melnikov <alexey.melnikov@isode.com>
	* lib/common.c: Fixed some Windows warnings in SASL security layer
	  handling.

2011-01-19  Alexey Melnikov <alexey.melnikov@isode.com>
	* plugins/scram.c: Made the default number of SCRAM hash iterations
	  configurable using a new SASL option called "scram_iteration_counter".
	  Also fixed a couple of error messages.

2011-01-19  Alexey Melnikov <alexey.melnikov@isode.com>
	* utils/pluginviewer.c: Fixed some Linux warnings in pluginviewer.

2011-01-19  Alexey Melnikov <alexey.melnikov@isode.com>
	* plugins/scram.c: Added support for storing SCRAM secrets in
	  authPassword attribute. Also added the "scram_secret_generate" option
	  for controlling if authPassword SCRAM secret should be generated
	  or not. By default (when not specified) the authPassword SCRAM secret
	  is NOT generated.

2011-01-19  Alexey Melnikov <alexey.melnikov@isode.com>
	* plugins/scram.c: Updated the SCRAM plugin not to use the hardcoded
	  SCRAM-SHA-1 plugin name in logging.

2011-01-18  Alexey Melnikov <alexey.melnikov@isode.com>
	* plugins/digestmd5.c: Use the same username for reauthentication
	  cache lookup and update. Thanks to Ken for pointing out the
	  problem.

2011-01-14  Ken Murchison <murch@andrew.cmu.edu>
	* plugins/ntlm.c: Flag NTLM plugin as HTTP-ready

2011-01-14  Ken Murchison <murch@andrew.cmu.edu>
	* include/sasl.h, include/saslplug.h,
	  lib/common.c, lib/server.c, plugins/digest-md5.c:
	  Allow DIGEST-MD5 plugin to be used for server-side 
	  HTTP Digest (RFC 2617)

2010-12-01  Alexey Melnikov <alexey.melnikov@isode.com>
	* lib/server.c: Some reformatting and safer handling of 'free
	  after SASL server shutdown' condition in server_dispose.

2010-12-01  Alexey Melnikov <alexey.melnikov@isode.com>
	* lib/server.c: server_idle needs to obey server's SASL mechanism
	  list from the server context.

2010-12-01  Alexey Melnikov <alexey.melnikov@isode.com>
	* lib/client.c, lib/saslint.h: Added support for ordering
	  SASL mechanisms by strength (on the client side),
	  or using the client_mech_list option.

2010-12-01  Alexey Melnikov <alexey.melnikov@isode.com>
	* include/sasl.h, include/saslplug.h, lib/client.c, lib/common.c,
	  lib/saslint.h, lib/server.c, sample/Makefile.am, sample/client.c,
	  sample/server.c: Added support for channel bindings
	  (patch by Luke Howard).

2010-12-01  Alexey Melnikov <alexey.melnikov@isode.com>
	* lib/saslutil.c: Fixed the random number generator on Windows
	  to actually produce random output on each run.

2010-12-01  Alexey Melnikov <alexey.melnikov@isode.com>
	* lib/common.c: Updated textual representations of some error
	  messages

2010-11-30  Alexey Melnikov <alexey.melnikov@isode.com>
	* plugins/digestmd5.c: Eliminated some "signed/unsigned mismatch"
	  warnings.

2010-11-30  Alexey Melnikov <alexey.melnikov@isode.com>
	* plugins/digestmd5.c, plugins/srp.c, plugins/otp.c,
	  plugins/ntlm.c, plugins/login.c, plugins/cram.c:
	  Be protective against calling sasl_server_step
	  once authentication has failed.

2010-11-30  Alexey Melnikov <alexey.melnikov@isode.com>
	* plugins/digestmd5.c: Minimize the number of auxprop lookups
	  in the server side DIGEST-MD5 plugin for the most common
	  case when authentication and authorization identities are
	  the same.

2010-11-30  Alexey Melnikov <alexey.melnikov@isode.com>
	* plugins/digestmd5.c: Updated digestmd5_server_mech_step2()
	  to be more defensive against empty client input.

2010-11-30  Alexey Melnikov <alexey.melnikov@isode.com>
	* plugins/digestmd5.c: Fixed some memory leaks on failed
	  plugin initialization. Prevent potential race condition
	  when freeding plugin state. Set the freed reauthentication
	  cache mutex to NULL, to make errors due to mutex access
	  after free more obvious.

2010-11-30  Alexey Melnikov <alexey.melnikov@isode.com>
	* plugins/digestmd5.c: Test against broken UTF-8 based hashes
	  if calculation using special ISO-8859-1 code fails.
	  This affected some XMPP clients. Patch by Dave Cridland
	  <dave.cridland@isode.com>.

2010-11-30  Alexey Melnikov <alexey.melnikov@isode.com>
	* plugins/digestmd5.c: Fixed an interop problem with some
	  LDAP clients ignoring server advertised realm
	  and providing their own.

2009-08-14  Alexey Melnikov <alexey.melnikov@isode.com>
	* saslauthd/auth_shadow.c: Rolled back the previous commit
	  (#define _XOPEN_SOURCE before including unistd.h),
	  as this seems to break Solaris 8 build. Note that crypt.h
	  should be present on a Solaris 8 machine, as well is on Debian,
	  so this shouldn't be a problem.

2009-08-04  Alexey Melnikov <alexey.melnikov@isode.com>
	* plugins/gssapi.c: Properly set serveroutlen to 0 in one place.
	  Don't send empty challenge once server context establishment is done,
	  as this is in violation of the RFC 2222 and its successor.

2009-07-24  Alexey Melnikov <alexey.melnikov@isode.com>
	* plugins/gssapi.c: Don't send maxbuf, if no security layer
	  can be established. Added additional checks for buffer lengths.

2009-05-03  Alexey Melnikov <alexey.melnikov@isode.com>
	* lib/NTMakefile: Disabled annoying warnings about use of
	  deprecated standard C library functions, enabled
	  warnings about Windows64 portability

2009-05-03  Alexey Melnikov <alexey.melnikov@isode.com>
	* configure.in: Added support for SQLite3
	  (patch by Maxim Gorbachyov)

2009-04-27  Ken Murchison <murch@andrew.cmu.edu>
	* lib/saslutil.c: Fixed CERT VU#238019 (make sure sasl_encode64()
	  always NUL terminates output or returns SASL_BUFOVER).

2009-04-11  Alexey Melnikov <alexey.melnikov@isode.com>
	* plugins/sql.c: Fixed SQLite lookup function.
	  Also fixed SASL PLAIN authentication when used with
	  SQLite auxprop backend.

2009-04-11  Alexey Melnikov <alexey.melnikov@isode.com>
