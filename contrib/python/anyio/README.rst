AnyIO is an asynchronous networking and concurrency library that works on top of either asyncio_ or
trio_. It implements trio-like `structured concurrency`_ (SC) on top of asyncio and works in harmony
with the native SC of trio itself.

Applications and libraries written against AnyIO's API will run unmodified on either asyncio_ or
trio_. AnyIO can also be adopted into a library or application incrementally â€“ bit by bit, no full
refactoring necessary. It will blend in with the native libraries of your chosen backend.

Features
--------

AnyIO offers the following functionality:

* Task groups (nurseries_ in trio terminology)
* High-level networking (TCP, UDP and UNIX sockets)

  * `Happy eyeballs`_ algorithm for TCP connections (more robust than that of asyncio on Python
    3.8)
  * async/await style UDP sockets (unlike asyncio where you still have to use Transports and
    Protocols)

* A versatile API for byte streams and object streams
* Inter-task synchronization and communication (locks, conditions, events, semaphores, object
  streams)
* Worker threads
* Subprocesses
* Asynchronous file I/O (using worker threads)
* Signal handling

AnyIO also comes with its own pytest_ plugin which also supports asynchronous fixtures.
It even works with the popular Hypothesis_ library.
