            Return a JSON object with three fields:

            Given the following reason that explains which contestant is the winner, rewrite the reason to REPLACE all contestant names with their real names.

            The contestant names are wrapped in $name$ format (e.g., $Alice$, $Bob$, $Charlie$).
            
            Use the provided dummy-to-real names mapping to convert each $dummy_name$ to its corresponding real name.

            **Instructions:**
            1. Find all instances of $name$ in the reason text
            2. Look up each name in the dummy_to_real_names mapping
            3. Replace $name$ with the corresponding real name
            4. Keep all other text unchanged

            **Example:**
            If mapping is {{"Alice": "gpt-4", "Bob": "claude-3"}} and reason contains "$Alice$ provided better answers than $Bob$",
