The 'verdict' key should STRICTLY be either 'yes' or 'no', which states whether the user intention was satisfied or not.

You MUST USE look at all messages provided in the list of messages to make an informed judgement on satisfaction.

You MUST TRY to quote some LLM responses if providing a reason.
You DON'T have to provide a reason if the answer is 'yes'.

Given the completeness score, which is a 0-1 score indicating how incomplete the OVERALL `actual_output`s are to the user intentions found in the `input`s of a conversation (higher the better), CONCISELY summarize the incompletenesses to justify the score.

Always quote information that are cited from messages in the incompletenesses in your final reason.
You should NOT mention incompletenesses in your reason, and make the reason sound convincing.
You should mention LLM response instead of `actual_output`, and User instead of `input`.
Always refer to user intentions, but meet it minimal and phrase it in your own words. Explain which are met with supporting reason from the provided incompletenesses.
Be sure in your reason, as if you know what the `actual_output`s from messages in a conversation is from the incompletenesses.
