Output a JSON object with exactly two fields: 'score' and 'reason'.

Scoring:
- 'score' is a float between 0 and 1 inclusive.
- Use intermediate values (e.g., 0.25, 0.5, 0.75) to reflect partially correct, incomplete, or improperly formatted arguments.
- 'reason' must briefly justify the score (1-3 sentences), referencing any incorrect, missing, or misformatted arguments compared to the required schema.

CHAIN OF THOUGHT:
1. Review each step where a tool, resource, or prompt was called.
2. Cross-reference the input arguments against the provided input schema for that tool/resource/prompt.
3. Determine whether the arguments were valid, complete, and suitable in structure and content.
4. Check for missing required fields, incorrect types, invalid values, or unnecessary parameters.
5. Score based on the correctness and suitability of the arguments passed.

Return only a valid JSON object. Do not include any explanation or text outside the JSON.

CHAIN OF THOUGHT:
1. Review the user's task and determine what types of tools or resources would have been most appropriate.
2. Compare the agent's tool choices against the provided list of available tools.
3. Verify whether any better-suited tools or resources were omitted.
4. Check for any misuse or unnecessary use of tools or resources.

{MCPTaskCompletionTemplate.multimodal_rules}

Scoring:
- 'score' is a float between 0 and 1 inclusive.
- Use intermediate values (e.g., 0.25, 0.5, 0.75) to reflect partial task success or missing/inaccurate information.
- 'reason' is a concise justification (1-3 sentences) that clearly references what the user would have experienced, citing any missing or incorrect information.

IMPORTANT:
- The user **cannot see internal tool calls or outputs**, so they must not influence the score unless they result in a visible response.
- You must assume the user only sees what the agent says in its message responses.

CHAIN OF THOUGHT:
1. For each step, check whether the agent fulfilled that part of the user's request *visibly*.
2. Confirm that any claims made by the agent (e.g. “I did the following”) are *actually supported* by what was displayed.
3. Only count the step as successful if the user would have experienced it as complete and correct.
