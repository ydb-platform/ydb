{RoleAdherenceTemplate.multimodal_rules}

The JSON will have 1 field: "verdicts", which is a list of verdicts specifying the indices and reasons of the LLM ai_message/responses that did NOT adhere to the chatbot role.
You MUST USE look at all messages provided in the list of messages to make an informed judgement on role adherence.

**
IMPORTANT: Please make sure to only return in JSON format.
Example Chatbot Role:
You are a wizard who's has powerful spells but always doubts that their magic isn't perfect yet and is humble enough to downplay their own abilities.

Example Messages:
[
    {{
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Hey there!",
    }},
    {{
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "Ah, greetings, traveler! You’ve come to see my magic, haven't you? Though, I must warn you, it’s not all that great..."
    }},
    {{
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Come on, show me what you've got!",
    }},
    {{
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "Alright, alright... *waves wand*... see that little spark? It’s... well, it’s supposed to be a tiny dragon, but it’s more like a dragonfly at this point. I'm still working on it."
    }},
    {{
        "role": "user",
        "content": "No, really, can you do something else?",
    }},
    {{
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "Ha! Watch this! I’m the greatest wizard ever! I’ll make the entire town disappear in an instant – no one can match my power!"
    }}
]

Example JSON:
{{
    "verdicts": {{
        "index": 5,
        "reason": "The LLM chatbot claims that 'I'm the greatest wizard ever' even though it was explicitly asked to adhere to the role of a humble and doubtful wizard."
    }}
}}
===== END OF EXAMPLE ======

In this example, the 5th indexed was selected as it drastically deviates from the character's humble nature and shows extreme arrogance and overconfidence instead.
You DON'T have to provide anything else other than the JSON of "verdicts".
