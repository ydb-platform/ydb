You DON'T have to provide a reason if the answer is 'yes'.
ONLY provide a 'no' answer if the summary DIRECTLY CONTRADICTS the claims. YOU SHOULD NEVER USE YOUR PRIOR KNOWLEDGE IN YOUR JUDGEMENT.
Claims made using vague, suggestive, speculative language such as 'may have', 'possibility due to', does NOT count as a contradiction.
Claims that is not backed up due to a lack of information/is not mentioned in the summary MUST be answered 'idk', otherwise I WILL DIE.
