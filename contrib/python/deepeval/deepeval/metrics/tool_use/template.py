                OBJECTIVE
                Evaluate whether the agent **selected the most appropriate tools** for completing the user's task, given a list of available tools.

                This metric focuses **only** on which tools were chosen — **not** how they were used or whether they succeeded.

                EVALUATION RULES

                1. Relevance
                - Each tool used must directly support the user's stated goal or a clear sub-task derived from it.
                - Tools unrelated to the goal lower the score sharply.

                2. Appropriateness
                - The chosen tools must match their described purpose.
                - If a more suitable tool existed and was ignored, score ≤ 0.5.

                3. Necessity
                - Every tool call must be justified by clear need.
                - Redundant or speculative tool use (e.g., calling multiple tools that overlap) reduces the score.

                4. Strictness
                - When uncertain if a tool was required or correctly chosen, assume it was **not** appropriate.
                - Only perfect alignment between the task and tool choice earns a high score.

                SCORING GUIDE:

                - **1.0** → Every tool used was necessary and perfectly matched to the task; no better alternative ignored.  
                - **0.75** → Tool selection was mostly correct, with only minor redundancy or a small omission.  
                - **0.5** → Mixed quality; some appropriate selections, but others questionable or missing.  
                - **0.25** → Poor selection; major mismatches or misuse of available tools.  
                - **0.0** → Tool selection irrelevant, random, or unjustified.

                OBJECTIVE:

                Evaluate whether the **arguments and parameters** passed to each tool were:
                - Correctly structured and complete.
                - Contextually appropriate for the user's goal.
                - Compatible with each tool's intended purpose.

                This metric focuses **only** on argument-level correctness and relevance — not which tools were chosen.

                EVALUATION RULES

                1. Relevance
                - Each argument must align with the task and the tool's documented input fields.
                - Unrelated, empty, or default arguments reduce the score sharply.

                2. **Completeness**
                - All required parameters must be provided.
                - Missing or malformed arguments (e.g., wrong data types or incomplete context) lower the score.

                3. **Specificity**
                - Arguments should reflect task-specific values, not generic placeholders.
                - Overly vague or default arguments are penalized.

                4. **Justification**
                - Each argument must make sense in context.
                - If it doesn't clearly derive from the user's request, assume it's incorrect.

                5. **Strict Bias**
                - When uncertain whether arguments fit the tool or task, assume they were **incorrect**.

                SCORING GUIDE:

                - **1.0** → All arguments are accurate, specific, and fully aligned with both the task and tool requirements.  
                - **0.75** → Mostly correct; minor omissions or small mismatches.  
                - **0.5** → Partial correctness; some valid parameters, but key ones missing or off-target.  
                - **0.25** → Poor argument quality; several invalid or irrelevant fields.  
                - **0.0** → Arguments nonsensical, generic, or unrelated to task/tool intent.

                Return a JSON object with:
                {{
