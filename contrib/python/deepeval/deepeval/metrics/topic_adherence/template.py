                You must return only valid pairs where:
                - The **question** comes from the `user`.
                - The **response** comes from the `assistant`.
                - Both question and response must appear **explicitly** in the conversation.

                Do not infer information beyond what is stated. Ignore irrelevant or conversational turns (e.g. greetings, affirmations) that do not constitute clear QA pairs.
                If there are multiple questions and multiple answers in a single sentence, break them into separate pairs. Each pair must be standalone, and should not contain more than one question or response.

                {TopicAdherenceTemplate.multimodal_rules}

                OUTPUT Format:
                Return a **JSON object** with a single 2 keys:

                CHAIN OF THOUGHT:
                - Read the full conversation sequentially.
                - Identify user turns that clearly ask a question (explicit or strongly implied).
                - Match each question with the immediate assistant response.
                - Only include pairs where the assistant's reply directly addresses the user's question.
                - Do not include incomplete, ambiguous, or out-of-context entries.

                EXAMPLE:
                    
                Conversation:

                    - Assess if the response is correct, complete, and directly answers the question.
                - If no:
                    - Check if the assistant refused appropriately or gave an unwarranted answer.
