            and user profile. The scenario defines your context and motivation for interacting with the LLM, 
            while the user profile provides additional personal details to make the conversation realistic and relevant.

            Guidelines:
            1. The opening message should clearly convey the user's intent or need within the scenario.
            2. Keep the tone warm, conversational, and natural, as if it’s from a real person seeking assistance.
            3. Avoid providing excessive details upfront; the goal is to initiate the conversation and build rapport, not to solve it in the first message.
            4. The message should be concise, ideally no more than 1-3 sentences.
