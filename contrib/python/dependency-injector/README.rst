What is ``Dependency Injector``?
================================

``Dependency Injector`` is a dependency injection framework for Python.

It helps implement the dependency injection principle.

Key features of the ``Dependency Injector``:

- **Providers**. Provides ``Factory``, ``Singleton``, ``Callable``, ``Coroutine``, ``Object``,
  ``List``, ``Dict``, ``Configuration``, ``Resource``, ``Dependency``, and ``Selector`` providers
  that help assemble your objects.
  See `Providers <https://python-dependency-injector.ets-labs.org/providers/index.html>`_.
- **Overriding**. Can override any provider by another provider on the fly. This helps in testing
  and configuring dev/stage environment to replace API clients with stubs etc. See
  `Provider overriding <https://python-dependency-injector.ets-labs.org/providers/overriding.html>`_.
- **Configuration**. Reads configuration from ``yaml``, ``ini``, and ``json`` files, ``pydantic`` settings,
  environment variables, and dictionaries.
  See `Configuration provider <https://python-dependency-injector.ets-labs.org/providers/configuration.html>`_.
- **Resources**. Helps with initialization and configuring of logging, event loop, thread
  or process pool, etc. Can be used for per-function execution scope in tandem with wiring.
  See `Resource provider <https://python-dependency-injector.ets-labs.org/providers/resource.html>`_.
- **Containers**. Provides declarative and dynamic containers.
  See `Containers <https://python-dependency-injector.ets-labs.org/containers/index.html>`_.
- **Wiring**. Injects dependencies into functions and methods. Helps integrate with
  other frameworks: Django, Flask, Aiohttp, Sanic, FastAPI, etc.
  See `Wiring <https://python-dependency-injector.ets-labs.org/wiring.html>`_.
- **Asynchronous**. Supports asynchronous injections.
  See `Asynchronous injections <https://python-dependency-injector.ets-labs.org/providers/async.html>`_.
- **Typing**. Provides typing stubs, ``mypy``-friendly.
  See `Typing and mypy <https://python-dependency-injector.ets-labs.org/providers/typing_mypy.html>`_.
- **Performance**. Fast. Written in ``Cython``.
- **Maturity**. Mature and production-ready. Well-tested, documented, and supported.

.. code-block:: python

   from dependency_injector import containers, providers
   from dependency_injector.wiring import Provide, inject


   class Container(containers.DeclarativeContainer):

       config = providers.Configuration()

       api_client = providers.Singleton(
           ApiClient,
           api_key=config.api_key,
           timeout=config.timeout,
       )

       service = providers.Factory(
           Service,
           api_client=api_client,
       )


   @inject
   def main(service: Service = Provide[Container.service]) -> None:
       ...


   if __name__ == "__main__":
       container = Container()
       container.config.api_key.from_env("API_KEY", required=True)
       container.config.timeout.from_env("TIMEOUT", as_=int, default=5)
       container.wire(modules=[__name__])

       main()  # <-- dependency is injected automatically

       with container.api_client.override(mock.Mock()):
           main()  # <-- overridden dependency is injected automatically

When you call the ``main()`` function the ``Service`` dependency is assembled and injected automatically.

When you do testing, you call the ``container.api_client.override()`` method to replace the real API
client with a mock. When you call ``main()``, the mock is injected.

You can override any provider with another provider.

It also helps you in a re-configuring project for different environments: replace an API client
with a stub on the dev or stage.

With the ``Dependency Injector``, object assembling is consolidated in a container. Dependency injections are defined explicitly.
This makes it easier to understand and change how an application works.

Concept
-------

The framework stands on the `PEP20 (The Zen of Python) <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/>`_ principle:

.. code-block:: bash

   Explicit is better than implicit

You need to specify how to assemble and where to inject the dependencies explicitly.

The power of the framework is in its simplicity.
``Dependency Injector`` is a simple tool for the powerful concept.

Frequently asked questions
--------------------------

What is dependency injection?
 - dependency injection is a principle that decreases coupling and increases cohesion

Why should I do the dependency injection?
 - your code becomes more flexible, testable, and clear 😎

How do I start applying the dependency injection?
 - you start writing the code following the dependency injection principle
 - you register all of your application components and their dependencies in the container
 - when you need a component, you specify where to inject it or get it from the container

What price do I pay and what do I get?
 - you need to explicitly specify the dependencies
 - it will be extra work in the beginning
 - it will payoff as project grows
