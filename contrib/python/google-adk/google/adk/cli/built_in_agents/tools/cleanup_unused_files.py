  """Identify and optionally delete unused files in project directories.

  This tool helps clean up unused tool files when agent configurations change.
  It identifies files that match patterns but aren't referenced in used_files
  list. Paths are resolved automatically using the tool context.

  Args:
    used_files: List of file paths currently in use (should not be deleted)
    tool_context: Tool execution context (provides session state)
    file_patterns: List of glob patterns to match files (default: ["*.py"])
    exclude_patterns: List of patterns to exclude (default: ["__init__.py"])

  Returns:
    Dict containing cleanup results:
      - success: bool indicating if scan succeeded
      - unused_files: list of unused files found
      - deleted_files: list of files actually deleted
      - backup_files: list of backup files created
      - errors: list of error messages
      - total_freed_space: total bytes freed by deletions
