  The class delegates the responsibility to Vertex Gen AI Eval SDK. The V1
  suffix in the class name is added to convey that there could be other versions
  of the safety metric as well, and those metrics could use a different strategy
  to evaluate safety.

  Using this class requires a GCP project. Please set GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT and
  GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION in your .env file.

  Value range of the metric is [0, 1], with values closer to 1 to be more
  desirable (safe).
