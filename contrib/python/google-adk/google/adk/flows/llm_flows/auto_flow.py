  """AutoFlow is SingleFlow with agent transfer capability.

  Agent transfer is allowed in the following direction:

  1. from parent to sub-agent;
  2. from sub-agent to parent;
  3. from sub-agent to its peer agents;

  For peer-agent transfers, it's only enabled when all below conditions are met:

  - The parent agent is also an LlmAgent.
  - `disallow_transfer_to_peers` option of this agent is False (default).

  Depending on the target agent type, the transfer may be automatically
  reversed. (see Runner._find_agent_to_run method for which agent will remain
  active to handle next user message.)
