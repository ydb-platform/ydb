  """Migrates a database from its current version to the latest version.

  If the source database schema is older than the latest version, this
  function applies migration scripts sequentially until the schema reaches the
  LATEST_VERSION.

  If multiple migration steps are required, intermediate results are stored in
  temporary SQLite database files. This means a multistep migration
  between other database types (e.g. PostgreSQL to PostgreSQL) will use
  SQLite for intermediate steps.

  In-place migration (source_db_url == dest_db_url) is not supported,
  as migrations always read from a source and write to a destination.

  Args:
    source_db_url: The SQLAlchemy URL of the database to migrate from.
    dest_db_url: The SQLAlchemy URL of the database to migrate to. This must be
      different from source_db_url.

  Raises:
    RuntimeError: If source_db_url and dest_db_url are the same, or if no
      migration path is found.
