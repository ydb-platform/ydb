"""BigQuery Tools (Experimental).

BigQuery Tools under this module are hand crafted and customized while the tools
under google.adk.tools.google_api_tool are auto generated based on API
definition. The rationales to have customized tool are:

1. BigQuery APIs have functions overlaps and LLM can't tell what tool to use
2. BigQuery APIs have a lot of parameters with some rarely used, which are not
   LLM-friendly
3. We want to provide more high-level tools like forecasting, RAG, segmentation,
   etc.
4. We want to provide extra access guardrails in those tools. For example,
   execute_sql can't arbitrarily mutate existing data.
