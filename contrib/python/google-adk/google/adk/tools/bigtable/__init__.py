"""Bigtable Tools (Experimental).

Bigtable tools under this module are hand crafted and customized while the tools
under google.adk.tools.google_api_tool are auto generated based on API
definition. The rationales to have customized tool are:

1. A dedicated Bigtable toolset to provide an easier, integrated way to interact
with Bigtable for building AI Agent applications quickly.
2. We want to provide extra access guardrails and controls in those tools.
3. Use Bigtable Toolset for more customization and control to interact with
Bigtable tables.
