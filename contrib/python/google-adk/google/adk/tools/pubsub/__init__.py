"""Pub/Sub Tools (Experimental).

Pub/Sub Tools under this module are handcrafted and customized while the tools
under google.adk.tools.google_api_tool are auto generated based on API
definition. The rationales to have customized tool are:

1. Better handling of base64 encoding for published messages.
2. A richer subscribe-side API that reflects how users may want to pull/ack
   messages.
