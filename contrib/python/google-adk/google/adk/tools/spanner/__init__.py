"""Spanner Tools (Experimental).

Spanner Tools under this module are hand crafted and customized while the tools
under google.adk.tools.google_api_tool are auto generated based on API
definition. The rationales to have customized tool are:

1. A dedicated Spanner toolset to provide an easier, integrated way to interact
with Spanner database and tables for building AI Agent applications quickly.
2. We want to provide more high-level tools like Search, ML.Predict, and Graph
etc.
3. We want to provide extra access guardrails and controls in those tools.
For example, execute_sql can't arbitrarily mutate existing data.
4. We want to provide Spanner best practices and knowledge assistants for ad-hoc
analytics queries.
5. Use Spanner Toolset for more customization and control to interact with
Spanner database and tables.
