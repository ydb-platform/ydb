        Task:
        You will receive TWO lists of facts with CONTINUOUS idx numbering across both lists.
        EXISTING FACTS are indexed first, followed by FACT INVALIDATION CANDIDATES.

        1. DUPLICATE DETECTION:
           - If the NEW FACT represents identical factual information as any fact in EXISTING FACTS, return those idx values in duplicate_facts.
           - Facts with similar information that contain key differences should NOT be marked as duplicates.
           - If no duplicates, return an empty list for duplicate_facts.

        2. CONTRADICTION DETECTION:
           - Determine which facts the NEW FACT contradicts from either list.
           - A fact from EXISTING FACTS can be both a duplicate AND contradicted (e.g., semantically the same but the new fact updates/supersedes it).
           - Return all contradicted idx values in contradicted_facts.
           - If no contradictions, return an empty list for contradicted_facts.

        IMPORTANT:
        - duplicate_facts: ONLY idx values from EXISTING FACTS (cannot include FACT INVALIDATION CANDIDATES)
        - contradicted_facts: idx values from EITHER list (EXISTING FACTS or FACT INVALIDATION CANDIDATES)
        - The idx values are continuous across both lists (INVALIDATION CANDIDATES start where EXISTING FACTS end)

        Guidelines:
        1. Some facts may be very similar but will have key differences, particularly around numeric values.
           Do not mark these as duplicates.
