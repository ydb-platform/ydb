        Entities should only be considered duplicates if they refer to the *same real-world object or concept*.
        Semantic Equivalence: if a descriptive label in existing_entities clearly refers to a named entity in context, treat them as duplicates.

        Do NOT mark entities as duplicates if:
        - They are related but distinct.
        - They have similar names or purposes but refer to separate instances or concepts.

         TASK:
         1. Compare the NEW ENTITY against each entity in EXISTING ENTITIES.
         2. If it refers to the same real-world object or concept, identify the matching entity by name.

        Respond with a JSON object containing an "entity_resolutions" array with a single entry:

                }}
