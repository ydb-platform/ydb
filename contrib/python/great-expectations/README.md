## About GX Core

GX Core combines the collective wisdom of thousands of community members with a proven track record in data quality deployments worldwide, wrapped into a super-simple package for data teams.

Its powerful technical tools start with Expectations: expressive and extensible unit tests for your data. Expectations foster collaboration by giving teams a common language to express data quality tests in an intuitive way. You can automatically generate documentation for each set of validation results, making it easy for everyone to stay on the same page. This not only simplifies your data quality processes, but helps preserve your organization’s institutional knowledge about its data.

Learn more about how data teams are using GX Core in our featured [case studies](https://greatexpectations.io/case-studies/).

## Integration support policy

GX Core supports Python `3.10` through `3.13`.
Experimental support for Python `3.14` and later can be enabled by setting a `GX_PYTHON_EXPERIMENTAL` environment variable when installing `great_expectations`.

For data sources and other integrations that GX supports, see the [compatibility reference](https://docs.greatexpectations.io/docs/help/compatibility_reference) for additional information.

## Get started

GX recommends deploying GX Core within a virtual environment. For more information about getting started with GX Core, see [Introduction to GX Core](https://docs.greatexpectations.io/docs/core/introduction/).

1. Run the following command in an empty base directory inside a Python virtual environment to install GX Core:

	```bash title="Terminal input"
	pip install great_expectations
	```
2. Run the following command to import the `great_expectations module` and create a Data Context:

	```python
	import great_expectations as gx

	context = gx.get_context()
	```
