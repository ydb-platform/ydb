monotonic
=========
NOTE: **This library is considered stable and complete, and will not receive
any further updates. Python versions 3.3 and newer include
[``time.monotonic()``][0] in the standard library.**


This module provides a ``monotonic()`` function which returns the
value (in fractional seconds) of a clock which never goes backwards.
It is compatible with Python 2 and Python 3.

On Python 3.3 or newer, ``monotonic`` will be an alias of
[``time.monotonic``][0] from the standard library. On older versions,
it will fall back to an equivalent implementation:

 OS              | Implementation
-----------------|-----------------------------------------
 Linux, BSD, AIX | [clock_gettime][1]
 Windows         | [GetTickCount][2] or [GetTickCount64][3]
 OS X            | [mach_absolute_time][3]

If no suitable implementation exists for the current platform,
attempting to import this module (or to import from it) will
cause a RuntimeError exception to be raised.

monotonic is available via the Python Cheese Shop (PyPI):
