py3c
====

py3c helps you port C extensions to Python 3.

It provides a detailed guide, and a set of macros to make porting easy
and reduce boilerplate.


Design principles
-----------------

* Reduce chances of accidental subtle errors
* Minimize boilerplate
* Prefer the Python 3 way of doing things
* Minimize semantic changes under Python 2


Versions
--------

Projects using py3c will be compatible with CPython 2.6, 2.7, and 3.3+.


Guides
------

A detailed `porting guide`_ is provided.

A `cheatsheet`_ is available for those that already know the Python C API,
and want to know what the py3c macros do.

Installation
------------

If your build system supports pkg-config, you can set it up
to look for a system-wide installation of py3c.

Alternately, py3c can be used as a header-only library:
copy the headers to your project and use them.

If you wish to install py3c system-wide (e.g. if you are a distro packager),
see the Contributing_ chapter in the documentation.
