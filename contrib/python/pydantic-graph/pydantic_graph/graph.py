    In `pydantic-graph`, a graph is a collection of nodes that can be run in sequence. The nodes define
    their outgoing edges — e.g. which nodes may be run next, and thereby the structure of the graph.

    Here's a very simple example of a graph which increments a number by 1, but makes sure the number is never
    42 at the end.
