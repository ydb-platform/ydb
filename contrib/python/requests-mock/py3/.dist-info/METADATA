Intro
=====

`requests-mock` provides a building block to stub out the HTTP `requests`_ portions of your testing code.
You should checkout the `docs`_ for more information.

The Basics
==========

Everything in `requests`_ eventually goes through an adapter to do the transport work.
`requests-mock` creates a custom `adapter` that allows you to predefine responses when certain URIs are called.

There are then a number of methods provided to get the adapter used.

A simple example:

.. code:: python

    >>> import requests
    >>> import requests_mock

    >>> session = requests.Session()
    >>> adapter = requests_mock.Adapter()
    >>> session.mount('mock://', adapter)

    >>> adapter.register_uri('GET', 'mock://test.com', text='data')
    >>> resp = session.get('mock://test.com')
    >>> resp.status_code, resp.text
    (200, 'data')

Obviously having all URLs be `mock://` prefixed isn't going to be useful,
so you can use `requests_mock.Mocker` to get the adapter into place.

As a context manager:

.. code:: python

    >>> with requests_mock.Mocker() as m:
    ...     m.get('http://test.com', text='data')
    ...     requests.get('http://test.com').text
    ...
    'data'

Or as a decorator:

.. code:: python

    >>> @requests_mock.Mocker()
    ... def test_func(m):
    ...     m.get('http://test.com', text='data')
    ...     return requests.get('http://test.com').text
    ...
    >>> test_func()
    'data'

Or as a pytest fixture:

.. code:: python

    >>> def test_simple(requests_mock):
    ...    requests_mock.get('http://test.com', text='data')
    ...    assert 'data' == requests.get('http://test.com').text

For more information checkout the `docs`_.
