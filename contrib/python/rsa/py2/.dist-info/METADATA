[Python-RSA](https://stuvel.eu/rsa) is a pure-Python RSA implementation. It supports
encryption and decryption, signing and verifying signatures, and key
generation according to PKCS#1 version 1.5. It can be used as a Python
library as well as on the commandline. The code was mostly written by
Sybren A.  St√ºvel.

Documentation can be found at the [Python-RSA homepage](https://stuvel.eu/rsa).

Download and install using:

    pip install rsa

or download it from the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.org/project/rsa/).

Changes in 4.1-4.4
------------------

Version 4.1 dropped support for Python 2.7, and soon after that version 4.2 was released. Neither of the two made it explicit in `setup.cfg` that Python 3.5 or newer is required. This caused issues on Python 2.7, as Pip happily upgraded to the new version.

Version 4.3 is a re-tagged release of version 4.0. It is the last to support Python 2.7.

Version 4.4 will be a re-tagged release of version 4.2, and explicitly require Python 3.5 or newer.


Major changes in 4.0
--------------------

Version 3.4 was the last version in the 3.x range. Version 4.0 drops the following modules,
as they are insecure:

- `rsa._version133`
- `rsa._version200`
- `rsa.bigfile`
- `rsa.varblock`

Those modules were marked as deprecated in version 3.4.

Furthermore, in 4.0 the I/O functions is streamlined to always work with bytes on all
supported versions of Python.

Version 4.0 drops support for Python 2.6 and 3.3.
