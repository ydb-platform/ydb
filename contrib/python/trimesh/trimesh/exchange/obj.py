    Load a Wavefront OBJ file into kwargs for a trimesh.Scene
    object.

    Parameters
    --------------
    file_obj : file like object
      Contains OBJ data
    resolver : trimesh.visual.resolvers.Resolver
      Allow assets such as referenced textures and
      material files to be loaded
    group_material : bool
      Group faces that share the same material
      into the same mesh.
    skip_materials
      Don't load any materials.
    maintain_order
      Make the strongest attempt possible to not reorder faces
      or vertices which may result in visual artifacts and other
      odd behavior. The OBJ data structure is quite different than
      the "flat matching array" used by Trimesh and GLTF so this may
      not be completely possible.
    split_objects
      Whenever the loader encounters an `o` directive in the OBJ
      file, split the loaded result into a new Trimesh object.
    split_groups
        Whenever the loader encounters a `g` directive in the OBJ
        file, split the loaded result into a new Trimesh object.

    Returns
