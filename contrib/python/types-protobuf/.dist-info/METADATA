## Typing stubs for protobuf

This is a [PEP 561](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/)
type stub package for the [`protobuf`](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf) package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like
[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/),
[pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright),
[pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype/),
PyCharm, etc. to check code that uses
`protobuf`.

This version of `types-protobuf` aims to provide accurate annotations
for `protobuf==5.26.*`.
The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/protobuf. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

Generated using [mypy-protobuf==3.6.0](https://github.com/nipunn1313/mypy-protobuf/tree/v3.6.0) and libprotoc 25.1 on [protobuf v26.1](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases/tag/v26.1) (python protobuf==5.26.1)

This stub package is marked as [partial](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/#partial-stub-packages).
If you find that annotations are missing, feel free to contribute and help complete them.


See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `1017c525f84b5e78a75ad909c6a4ef2b5c0610e6` and was tested
with mypy 1.9.0, pyright 1.1.358, and
pytype 2024.4.11.
