# You can modify action, all_file_action and add commentaries
# Available actions:
# keep - keep license in contrib and use in credits
# skip - skip license
# remove - remove all files with this license
# rename - save license text/links into licenses texts file, but not store SPDX into LINCENSE macro. You should store correct license id into devtools.license.spdx.txt file
#
# {all file action} records will be generated when license text contains filename that exists on filesystem (in contrib directory)
# We suppose that that files can contain some license info
# Available all file actions:
# FILE_IGNORE - ignore file (do nothing)
# FILE_INCLUDE - include all file data into licenses text file
