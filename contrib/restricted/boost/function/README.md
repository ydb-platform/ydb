# Boost.Function, a polymorphic function wrapper

[Boost.Function](http://boost.org/libs/function), part of the
[Boost C++ Libraries](http://boost.org), is the original implementation of the
polymorphic function wrapper `boost::function`, which was eventually accepted
into the C++11 standard as [`std::function`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/functional/function).

## Currently supported compilers

* g++ 4.7 or later
* clang++ 3.9 or later
* Visual Studio 2013-2022

Tested on [Github Actions](https://github.com/boostorg/function/actions) and [Appveyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/pdimov/function/).
