  * Added: CMake option URIPARSER_SHARED_LIBS=(ON|OFF) to control,
      whether to produce a shared or static library for uriparser
      and that alone, falls back to standard BUILD_SHARED_LIBS
      if available, else defaults to "ON" (GitHub #169, GitHub #170)
  * Improved: Document that scheme-based normalization a la
      section 6.2.3 of RFC 3986 is a responsibility of the application
      using uriparser (GitHub #173, GitHub #174)
  * Improved: Document supported code points for functions uriEscape(Ex)W
      (GitHub #171, GitHub #175)

  * Improved: Use name UriConfig.h rather than generic config.h for the
      config header file to avoid name clashes and also include it through
      "UriConfig.h" with quotes rather than <UriConfig.h> so that it is found
      in quote path locations (GitHub #149)
      Thanks to Gaspard Petit for bringing this up!

>>>>>>>>>>>>> SECURITY >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
  * Fixed: [CVE-2021-46141]
      Fix a bug affecting both uriNormalizeSyntax* and uriMakeOwner*
      functions where the text range in .hostText would not be duped using
      malloc but remain unchanged (and hence "not owned") for URIs with
      an IPv4 or IPv6 address hostname; depending on how an application
      uses uriparser, this could lead the application into a use-after-free
      situation.
      As the second half, fix uriFreeUriMembers* functions that would not
      free .hostText memory for URIs with an IPv4 or IPv6 address host;
      also, calling uriFreeUriMembers* multiple times on a URI of this
      very nature would result in trying to free pointers to stack
      (rather than heap) memory (GitHub #121, GitHub #124)
      Commit 987b046e41f407d17c622e580fc82a5e834b4329
      Commit b1a34743bc1472e055d886e29e9b53f670eb3282
  * Fixed: [CVE-2021-46142]
      Fix functions uriNormalizeSyntax* for out-of-memory situations
      (i.e. malloc returning NULL) for URIs containing empty segments
      (any of user info, host text, query, or fragment) where previously
      pointers to stack (rather than heap) memory were freed (GitHub #122,
      GitHub #124)

2008-09-01 -- 0.7.2

  * Fixed: Bad cleanup logic in functions
      - uriAddBaseUri(..)
      - uriRemoveBaseUri(..)
      Previously you needed to call uriFreeUriMembers on return code
      URI_ERROR_MALLOC and only then. So that's why these functions now
      take cleanup off your shoulders. An extra call to uriFreeUriMembers
      from your side is still needed in case of success.

2008-04-27 -- 0.7.1

  * Fixed: Bogus syntax error when parsing URIs with port-like
      passwords, e.g. "http://user:21@host/" (SF.net bug #1)
      Thanks to Friedrich Delgado Friedrichs for reporting!
  * Fixed: Parser did not handle trailing slashes correctly in some cases,
      which also made the structures produced from parsing "http://e.com/"
      and "http://e.com" indistinguishable. (SF.net bug #2)
      Thanks to Edward Z. Yang for reporting!

2008-04-04 -- 0.7.0

  * Added: Code::Blocks workspace file
  * Soname: 1:5:0

2008-02-25 -- 0.6.4

  * Added: Syntax-based normalization can now handle relative URIs,
      e.g. "../../a/b/.././c" is normalized to "../../a/c"
  * Fixed: Normalization code could free foreign memory
  * Fixed: Normalization processed the path segment even when asked not to
  * Added: MinGW Makefile and related readme
      Thanks to Michael Anthony Puls II!
  * Fixed: Documentation bug not requiring enough memory for the output
      buffer when converting a relative file URI back to a filename
  * Soname: 1:4:0

2008-02-11 -- 0.6.3

  * Fixed: Two major crash bugs in normalization code
      Thanks to Adrian Manrique for the patch!
  * Added: Brief usage tutorial
  * Soname: 1:3:0

2008-02-08 -- 0.6.2

  * Fixed: Freeing a normalized URI like "http://test?"
      caused a crash. Thanks to Adrian Manrique for reporting!
  * Fixed: Filename <--> URI string conversion helpers can
      now handle relative URIs and filenames
  * Soname: 1:2:0

2007-12-23 -- 0.6.1

  * Fixed: Percent-encodings in hostnames were not repaired during normalization.
      Thanks to Adrian Manrique for reporting!
  * Fixed: Percent-encodings were fixed after dot removal not before during
      normalization.
      Thanks to Adrian Manrique for reporting!
  * Fixed: Include path order bug
      Thanks to Ed Schouten for reporting this!
  * Fixed: Shadow builds now possible
      Thanks to Adeodato Simó for the patch!
  * Added: Version guards for Autoconf/Automake
      Thanks to Martin Michlmayr for reporting!
  * Soname: 1:1:0

2007-09-17 -- 0.6.0

  * Fixed: Proper soname updates from now on, starting at 1:0:0
  * Removed: Visual Studio 2003 project files

2007-09-13 -- 0.5.2

  * Added: RemoveBaseUri function to create URI references
  * Added: Unix/Windows filename <--> URI string conversion helpers
  * Added: EscapeEx function to escape text blocks without zero termination
  * Fixed: Bug in ToString for URIs with scheme, path, but no host (e.g. "f:/.//g")
  * Fixed: AddBase now resolves ".//g" with base "f:/a" to "f:/.//g" instead of
      "f://g" which would result in "g" becoming the authority part when parsing
      a recomposition (ToString) of that URI structure. This is a whole in RFC 3986,
      see http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/uri/2007Aug/0003.html for details.

2007-08-09 -- 0.5.1

  * Fixed: Empty host bug (URIs like "///g")
  * Fixed: Relative URIs are no longer touched by normalization
  * Fixed: MergePath failed for empty paths
  * Fixed: Bug with "." segments in AddBase
      All of the above revealed by test cases from 4Suite (http://4suite.org/)

2007-07-28 -- 0.5.0

  * Added: Syntax-based normalization
  * Added: Percent-encoding function Escape
  * Improved: Malloc/NULL checks added
  * Added: New function UnescapeInPlaceEx can also decode '+' to ' '
      and convert line breaks
  * Added: Exact space computation for ToString, see ToStringCharsRequired
  * Added: --enable-sizedown for saving space and slower code
  * Fixed: Two internal functions were exposed in the API by mistake:
      uriPushToStack and uriStackToOctet
  * Added: Visual Studio 2005 project files
  * Removed: Legacy code (removal was announced for 0.5.0)

2007-07-06 -- 0.4.1

2007-07-03 -- 0.4.0

  * Added: References resolution (think relative to absolute)
  * Added: Naive URI equality check
  * Added: URIs can now be converted back to strings
  * Fixed: The first path segment of a relative URI was eaten
      (functions ParseSegmentNz and ParseMustBeSegmentNzNc)
  * Fixed: uri->scheme.first was not reset in some cases
      (function ParseMustBeSegmentNzNc)
  * Improved: Test suite now built on "make check", not before
  * Fixed: Test suite always returned 0 (success)
