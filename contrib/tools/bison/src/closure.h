   ITEMS, of length N), set up RULESET and ITEMSET to indicate what
   rules could be run and which items could be accepted when those
   items are the active ones.

   RULESET contains a bit for each rule.  CLOSURE sets the bits for
   all rules which could potentially describe the next input to be
   read.

   ITEMSET is a sorted vector of item numbers; NITEMSET is its size
   (actually, points to just beyond the end of the part of it that is
   significant).  CLOSURE places there the indices of all items which
   represent units of input that could arrive next.  */
