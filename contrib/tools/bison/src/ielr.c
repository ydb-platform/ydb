                 Unlike in ielr_compute_always_follows, I use a bitset for
                 edges rather than an array because it is possible that
                 multiple RHS's with the same first symbol could fit and thus
                 that we could end up with redundant edges.  With the
                 possibility of redundant edges, it's hard to know ahead of
                 time how large to make such an array.  Another possible
                 redundancy is that source and destination might be the same
                 goto.  Eliminating all these possible redundancies now might
                 possibly help performance a little.  I have not proven any of
                 this, but I'm guessing the bitset shouldn't entail much of a
                 performance penalty, if any.  */

              /* FIXME: If splitting t2 here, it's possible that lookaheads
                 that had already propagated from *tp to t2 will be left in t2
                 after *tp has been removed as t2's predecessor:
                 - We're going to recompute all lookaheads in phase 4, so these
                   extra lookaheads won't appear in the final parser table.
                 - If t2 has just one annotation, then these extra lookaheads
                   cannot alter the dominating contribution to the associated
                   inadequacy and thus cannot needlessly prevent a future merge
                   of some new state with t2.  We can be sure of this because:
                   - The fact that we're splitting t2 now means that some
                     predecessors (at least one) other than *tp must be
                     propagating contributions to t2.
                   - The fact that t2 was merged in the first place means that,
                     if *tp propagated any contributions, the dominating
                     contribution must be the same as that from those other
                     predecessors.
                   - Thus, if some new state to be merged with t2 in the future
                     proves to be compatible with the contributions propagated
                     by the other predecessors, it will also be compatible with
                     the contributions made by the extra lookaheads left behind
                     by *tp.
                 - However, if t2 has more than one annotation and these extra
                   lookaheads contribute to one of their inadequacies, it's
                   possible these extra lookaheads may needlessly prevent a
                   future merge with t2.  For example:
                   - Let's say there's an inadequacy A that makes the split
                     necessary as follows:
                     - There's currently just one other predecessor and it
                       propagates to t2 some contributions to inadequacy A.
                     - The new lookaheads that we were attempting to propagate
                       from *tp to t2 made contributions to inadequacy A with a
                       different dominating contribution than those from that
                       other predecessor.
                     - The extra lookaheads either make no contribution to
                       inadequacy A or have the same dominating contribution as
                       the contributions from the other predecessor.  Either
                       way, as explained above, they can't prevent a future
                       merge.
                   - Let's say there's an inadequacy B that causes the trouble
                     with future merges as follows:
                     - The extra lookaheads make contributions to inadequacy B.
                     - Those extra contributions did not prevent the original
                       merge to create t2 because the other predecessor
                       propagates to t2 no contributions to inadequacy B.
                     - Thus, those extra contributions may prevent a future
                       merge with t2 even though the merge would be fine if *tp
                       had not left them behind.
                 - Is the latter case common enough to worry about?
                 - Perhaps we should track all predecessors and iterate them
                   now to recreate t2 without those extra lookaheads.  */
