TODO file for GNU m4

Tell <bug-m4@gnu.org> if you feel like volunteering for any
of these ideas, listed more or less in decreasing order of priority.

* Features or problems
  - Fix format() builtin to handle %c more like printf(1) in the shell
        http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-m4/2007-05/msg00047.html
    Also, gnulib needs help to overcome mingw bugs related to format().
  - Update documentation from accumulated mail about it
  - Study synclines at the very beginning of each diverted sequence
  - Make eval work on bignums - the 32 bits limit is artificial
        From Krste Asanovic <krste@icsi.berkeley.edu>, 1993-03-20

* Optimization and clean up
  - Check for memory leaks and uninitialized reads
        From Vern Paxson <vern@horse.ee.lbl.gov> on 1993-12-06
  - Profile GNU m4 and speed it up
        From David J. MacKenzie <djm@eng.umd.edu>, 1993-01-20

        GNU m4 should be sped up by a factor of three for competing
        with other versions (I think that the lexer is not agressive
        enough and too often return single characters; obstacks might
        be a little abused, too).
  - Have NULs go really undisturbed through GNU m4
        See `dumpdef' and debugging section, which abuses %s
        From Thorsten Ohl <ohl@chico.harvard.edu>, 1992-12-21

        path.c (add_include_directory): Why the '\0' terminator?

        GNU m4 is lousy regarding NULs in streams (this would require
        maintaining the string lengths, and avoiding strlen, strcpy,
        etc.).
