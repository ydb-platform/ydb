/* A hash table contains many internal entries, each holding a pointer to
   some user-provided data (also called a user entry).  An entry indistinctly
   refers to both the internal entry and its associated user entry.  A user
   entry contents may be hashed by a randomization function (the hashing
   function, or just "hasher" for short) into a number (or "slot") between 0
   and the current table size.  At each slot position in the hash table,
   starts a linked chain of entries for which the user data all hash to this
   slot.  A bucket is the collection of all entries hashing to the same slot.

   A good "hasher" function will distribute entries rather evenly in buckets.
   In the ideal case, the length of each bucket is roughly the number of
   entries divided by the table size.  Finding the slot for a data is usually
   done in constant time by the "hasher", and the later finding of a precise
   entry is linear in time with the size of the bucket.  Consequently, a
   larger hash table size (that is, a larger number of buckets) is prone to
   yielding shorter chains, *given* the "hasher" function behaves properly.

   Long buckets slow down the lookup algorithm.  One might use big hash table
   sizes in hope to reduce the average length of buckets, but this might
   become inordinate, as unused slots in the hash table take some space.  The
   best bet is to make sure you are using a good "hasher" function (beware
   that those are not that easy to write! :-), and to use a table size
   larger than the actual number of entries.  */

   This slot number is then returned.

   The user-supplied COMPARATOR function, when not NULL, accepts two
   arguments pointing to user data, it then returns true for a pair of entries
   that compare equal, or false otherwise.  This function is internally called
   on entries which are already known to hash to the same bucket index,
   but which are distinct pointers.

   The user-supplied DATA_FREER function, when not NULL, may be later called
   with the user data as an argument, just before the entry containing the
   data gets freed.  This happens from within 'hash_free' or 'hash_clear'.
   You should specify this function only if you want these functions to free
   all of your 'data' data.  This is typically the case when your data is
