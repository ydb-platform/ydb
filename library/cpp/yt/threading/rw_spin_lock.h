//! Single-writer multiple-readers spin lock.
/*!
 *  Reader-side acquires are pretty cheap, and readers don't spin unless writers
 *  are present.
 *
 *  The lock is unfair, but writers are prioritized over readers, that is,
 *  if AcquireWriter() is called at some time, then some writer
 *  (not necessarily the same one that called AcquireWriter) will succeed
 *  in the next time. This is implemented by an additional flag "WriterReady",
 *  that writers set on arrival. No readers can proceed until this flag is reset.
 *
 *  WARNING: You probably should not use this lock if forks are possible: see
 *  fork_aware_rw_spin_lock.h for a proper fork-safe lock which does the housekeeping for you.
 *
 *  WARNING: This lock is not recursive: you can't call AcquireReader() twice in the same
 *  thread, as that may lead to a deadlock. For the same reason you shouldn't do WaitFor or any
 *  other context switch under lock.
 *
 *  See tla+/spinlock.tla for the formally verified lock's properties.
