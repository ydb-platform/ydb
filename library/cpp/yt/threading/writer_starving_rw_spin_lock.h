// TODO(pavook): deprecate it.

//! Single-writer multiple-readers spin lock.
/*!
 *  Reader-side calls are pretty cheap.
 *  WARNING: The lock is unfair, and readers can starve writers. See rw_spin_lock.h for a writer-prioritized lock.
 *  WARNING: Never use the bare lock if forks are possible: see fork_aware_rw_spin_lock.h for a fork-safe lock.
 *  Unlike rw_spin_lock.h, reader-side is reentrant here: it is possible to acquire the **reader** lock multiple times
 *  even in the single thread.
 *  This doesn't mean you should do it: in fact, you shouldn't: use separate locks for separate entities.
 *  If you see this class in your code, try migrating to the proper rw_spin_lock.h after ensuring you don't rely on
 *  reentrant locking.
