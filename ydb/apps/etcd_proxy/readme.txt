Etcd over YDB. Zero version.

Main restriction: Can work only in single instance mode.

To remove the restriction two tasks must be done:
- First, get and update a current revision number on YDB side trought a separate request before any logical query.
- Second, use CDC for implement the watches instead of self-notifications.

And other todo's:
- Add merics.
- Add logging.
- Implement retries on "Transaction lock invslideted" error.
- Implement compaction with control of a requested revision.
- Implement the watches for ranges. (Now the watches work only with a single key or a prefix.)
- Add unit tests for watches.
