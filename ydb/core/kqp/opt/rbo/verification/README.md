# New RBO equivalence verifier

This directory contains the standalone bounded-equivalence checker described in
[PLAN.md](PLAN.md). It compares two versioned semantic snapshots and asks Z3 for
a bounded input database on which their result bags differ.

The current implementation contains the M1 logical kernel, the M2 C++ boundary
hooks, and the first M3 StageGraph routing slice. `CaptureSemanticSnapshotCatalogV1` records
the initial query-level catalog once, and `ExportSemanticSnapshotV1`
deterministically lowers supported RBO operators without doing file I/O. An
optional sink on `TKqlTransformContext` receives the initial snapshot before the
first RBO stage and the final snapshot immediately before physical generation.
Supported final plans include exact stage membership and Map, HashShuffle,
Broadcast, and serial or parallel UnionAll connections. Merge fields are
captured and decoded, but execution remains fail-closed until ordered Sort
semantics are modeled.

Stage execution uses at most two bounded source/shuffle tasks. Source-row task
placement and hash routing are shared symbolic functions, so a two-task source
covers both partitions instead of fixing rows to one convenient task. Map
preserves the producer count, serial UnionAll requires one consumer task,
parallel UnionAll uses the runtime's cross-input round-robin offset, and a
broadcast-only stage uses one task just as KQP task construction does. Invalid
connection combinations are rejected. The final stage is gathered before root
column projection.

The exporter and decoder both validate the StageGraph independently: plan nodes
partition into stages, each stage has one logical sink, every cross-stage child
occurrence has one edge, and producer output indices are a bijection with
outgoing edge occurrences. Shuffle-elimination/co-partitioning assumptions are
rejected until the snapshot can substantiate them.

Version one preserves exact supported YQL scalar identities (`Bool`, signed and
unsigned integer widths, `String`, and `Utf8`) even when several identities use
the same SMT domain.

The chosen final boundary is immediately before `ConvertToPhysical`. Therefore
the verifier does not prove physical lowering, task construction, or execution.
In particular, the current lowering does not visibly preserve
`TSortElement::NullsFirst`; explicit NULL ordering must remain a replay case
until that contract is clarified.

Merge order, including `nulls_first`, is preserved in the semantic snapshot.
The current root contract compares bags, so verification returns `UNSUPPORTED`
for Merge rather than discard order. Ordered result comparison is added together
with Sort in M4.

## StageGraph v1 shape

The strict decoder rejects unknown or missing fields. The abbreviated shape is:

```json
{
  "root_stage": "s2",
  "stages": [{
    "id": "s0",
    "nodes": ["n0"],
    "inputs": [],
    "outputs": [{"index": 0, "node": "n0"}],
    "source_storage": "row"
  }],
  "edges": [{
    "id": "e0",
    "producer": "s0",
    "consumer": "s2",
    "occurrence": 0,
    "producer_output": 0,
    "consumer_input": 0,
    "kind": "hash_shuffle",
    "keys": ["a.k"],
    "hash_function": "HashV1",
    "use_spilling": true
  }],
  "assumptions": []
}
```

Map and Broadcast add no variant fields. UnionAll adds `parallel`. Merge adds
`order`, whose elements contain `column`, `ascending`, and `nulls_first`.
`source_storage` is `row`, `column`, or `null`. Version one requires an empty
`assumptions` array.

## Development setup

The Python code has no package dependencies. Pass an explicit Z3-compatible
solver executable when asking it to solve a formula. During local development,
that can be a system or isolated-development Z3 installation; hermetic `ya`
integration will use a separately vendored binary.

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s ydb/core/kqp/opt/rbo/verification/ut
```

Run its tests with:

```bash
./ya make --build relwithdebinfo -tA \
  ydb/core/kqp/opt/rbo/verification/ut 2>&1 | tail
```

Solver integration tests are enabled when an explicit solver binary is
available. Formula construction and parsing tests do not depend on Z3.

Build the Ya-owned CLI with:

```bash
./ya make --build relwithdebinfo ydb/core/kqp/opt/rbo/verification/bin
```

## CLI

```bash
PYTHONPATH=ydb/core/kqp/opt/rbo/verification \
python3 -m rbo_verifier before.json after.json \
  --rows 2 --timeout-ms 10000 --solver /path/to/z3
```

The command prints a JSON verdict. A `COUNTEREXAMPLE` verdict contains only the
present base-table rows; opaque-function and symbolic-routing interpretations
are deliberately not treated as a stable witness format, so concrete replay is
the confirmation boundary. Every bounded verdict reports both `row_bound` and
the fixed `task_bound` of two. A `SCHEMA_MISMATCH` verdict is a direct
correctness failure and does not depend on either bound. Use `--emit-smt
formula.smt2` without `--solver` to inspect the exact proof obligation.
