# New RBO equivalence verifier

This directory contains the standalone bounded-equivalence checker described in
[PLAN.md](PLAN.md). It compares two versioned semantic snapshots and asks Z3 for
a bounded input database on which their result bags differ.

The current implementation contains the M1 logical kernel, the M2 C++ boundary
hooks, the M3 StageGraph routing slice, and the aggregate and unordered-Limit
parts of M4.
`CaptureSemanticSnapshotCatalogV1` records the initial query-level catalog once,
and `ExportSemanticSnapshotV1`
deterministically lowers supported RBO operators without doing file I/O. An
optional sink on `TKqlTransformContext` receives the initial snapshot before the
first RBO stage and the final snapshot immediately before physical generation.
`CreateKqpHost` accepts the same sink as immutable instrumentation configuration
and copies it into every per-query transform context created by the host.
Supported final plans include exact stage membership and Map, HashShuffle,
Broadcast, and serial or parallel UnionAll connections. Merge fields are
captured and decoded, but execution remains fail-closed until ordered Sort
semantics are modeled.

Stage execution uses at most two bounded source/shuffle tasks. Source-row task
placement and hash routing are shared symbolic functions, so a two-task source
covers both partitions instead of fixing rows to one convenient task. Map
preserves the producer count, serial UnionAll requires one consumer task,
parallel UnionAll uses the runtime's cross-input round-robin offset, and a
broadcast-only stage uses one task just as KQP task construction does. Invalid
connection combinations are rejected. The final stage is gathered before root
column projection.

The exporter and decoder both validate the StageGraph independently: plan nodes
partition into stages, each stage has one logical sink, every cross-stage child
occurrence has one edge, and producer output indices are a bijection with
outgoing edge occurrences. Shuffle-elimination/co-partitioning assumptions are
rejected until the snapshot can substantiate them.

Version one preserves exact supported YQL scalar identities (`Bool`, signed and
unsigned integer widths, `String`, and `Utf8`) even when several identities use
the same SMT domain. Integer slots currently use an unbounded SMT carrier rather
than explicit source-type range constraints. This may produce an out-of-range
`COUNTEREXAMPLE`, which replay can reject, but cannot turn a real bounded
counterexample into `VERIFIED_BOUNDED`.

The chosen final boundary is immediately before `ConvertToPhysical`. Therefore
the verifier does not prove physical lowering, task construction, or execution.
In particular, the current lowering does not visibly preserve
`TSortElement::NullsFirst`; explicit NULL ordering must remain a replay case
until that contract is clarified.

Merge order, including `nulls_first`, is preserved in the semantic snapshot.
The current root contract compares bags, so verification returns `UNSUPPORTED`
for Merge rather than discard order. Ordered result comparison is added together
with Sort in M4.

The aggregate subset covers grouped and scalar `count` and integer `sum`, NULL
grouping and inputs, and optimizer-generated intermediate/final phases. Signed
inputs widen to `Int64`, unsigned inputs widen to `Uint64`, and both sums use
the runtime's exact 64-bit modular overflow. A column-storage source is split
into symbolic source tasks before a pushed intermediate aggregate executes.
`distinct`, `DistinctAll`, `unwrap`, min/max, average, and variance currently
return `UNSUPPORTED` rather than use an approximation.
Intermediate aggregation models the pre-physical logical state per task and
key; memory-pressure batching performed later by a physical hash combiner is
outside the snapshot boundary.

An unordered `Limit` is not modeled as an arbitrary fixed vector prefix. For
each input outcome, the kernel enumerates every guarded-row mask whose size is
`min(count, max(input_size - offset, 0))`. Plans are equivalent only when their
sets of enabled output bags mutually include one another. Choice identities are
carried through the DAG, so two uses of one Limit node share a choice, while
stage-task instances choose independently. Count and offset are restricted to
non-null `Uint64` literals in v1; parameterized or otherwise computed limits
fail closed. Phase is preserved as `undefined`, `intermediate`, or `final`, but
does not itself change runtime semantics. Distinct Limit observers downstream
of one order-preserving plan stream fan-out fail closed until their latent
order correlation is modeled; Aggregate, Join, and UnionAll start new unordered
streams.

```json
{
  "id": "n2",
  "op": "limit",
  "input": "n1",
  "count": {"kind": "literal", "type": "Uint64", "value": 10},
  "offset": null,
  "phase": "final"
}
```

The current exporter emits `pushed_limit` on every scan, either `null` or the
same exact literal shape. Its absence in a legacy-v1 snapshot means `null`,
because the earlier v1 exporter rejected every pushed read limit. A non-null
pushed limit is valid only on a column-storage source and executes independently
on each source task after symbolic row partitioning.

The explicit outcome family is capped at 256 alternatives, including Cartesian
products and gathers, and cross-plan equality is capped at 4096 outcome pairs;
exceeding either audit bound returns `UNSUPPORTED` rather than approximating.

Aggregate nodes preserve ordered keys and traits, output type/nullability, and
phase explicitly:

```json
{
  "id": "n1",
  "op": "aggregate",
  "input": "n0",
  "keys": ["t.k"],
  "aggregates": [{
    "input": "t.v",
    "function": "count",
    "output": "cnt",
    "type": "Uint64",
    "nullable": false,
    "distinct": false,
    "unwrap": false
  }],
  "phase": "intermediate",
  "distinct_all": false
}
```

## StageGraph v1 shape

The strict decoder rejects unknown fields and missing required fields (with the
documented legacy-v1 scan exception above). The abbreviated shape is:

```json
{
  "root_stage": "s2",
  "stages": [{
    "id": "s0",
    "nodes": ["n0"],
    "inputs": [],
    "outputs": [{"index": 0, "node": "n0"}],
    "source_storage": "row"
  }],
  "edges": [{
    "id": "e0",
    "producer": "s0",
    "consumer": "s2",
    "occurrence": 0,
    "producer_output": 0,
    "consumer_input": 0,
    "kind": "hash_shuffle",
    "keys": ["a.k"],
    "hash_function": "HashV1",
    "use_spilling": true
  }],
  "assumptions": []
}
```

Map and Broadcast add no variant fields. UnionAll adds `parallel`. Merge adds
`order`, whose elements contain `column`, `ascending`, and `nulls_first`.
`source_storage` is `row`, `column`, or `null`. Version one requires an empty
`assumptions` array.

## Development setup

The Python code has no package dependencies. Pass an explicit Z3-compatible
solver executable when asking it to solve a formula. During local development,
that can be a system or isolated-development Z3 installation; hermetic `ya`
integration will use a separately vendored binary.

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s ydb/core/kqp/opt/rbo/verification/ut
```

Run its tests with:

```bash
./ya make --build relwithdebinfo -tA \
  ydb/core/kqp/opt/rbo/verification/ut 2>&1 | tail
```

Solver integration tests are enabled when an explicit solver binary is
available. Formula construction and parsing tests do not depend on Z3.

The medium integration test constructs a real new-RBO `IKqpHost`, compiles an
explicit `LIMIT 1` query, checks its initial and split intermediate/final Limit
shapes, and invokes the normal CLI on the captured pair. It always requires
successful strict decoding and SMT construction. Set `RBO_Z3` to additionally
require a `VERIFIED_BOUNDED` verdict; M2b will replace that opt-in path with a
hermetic solver dependency.

```bash
RBO_Z3=/path/to/z3 ./ya make --build relwithdebinfo -tA \
  ydb/core/kqp/opt/rbo/verification/integration_ut 2>&1 | tail
```

Build the Ya-owned CLI with:

```bash
./ya make --build relwithdebinfo ydb/core/kqp/opt/rbo/verification/bin
```

## CLI

```bash
PYTHONPATH=ydb/core/kqp/opt/rbo/verification \
python3 -m rbo_verifier before.json after.json \
  --rows 2 --timeout-ms 10000 --solver /path/to/z3
```

The command prints a JSON verdict. A `COUNTEREXAMPLE` verdict contains only the
present base-table rows; opaque-function and symbolic-routing interpretations
and the unmatched unordered-Limit choice are deliberately not treated as a
stable witness format, so concrete replay is the confirmation boundary. Every
bounded verdict reports both `row_bound` and the fixed `task_bound` of two. A
`SCHEMA_MISMATCH` verdict is a direct correctness failure and does not depend on
either bound. Use `--emit-smt formula.smt2` without `--solver` to inspect the
exact proof obligation.
