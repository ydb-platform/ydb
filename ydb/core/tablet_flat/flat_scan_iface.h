    /*_ IScan, the generic scan interface. Scan life cycle starts with
        invocation of Prepare(..) method after which it has to progress
        with IDriver::Touch(..).

        Once rows iterator invalidated Seek(..) method is called getting
        next position for seeking followed by a series of Feed(..)
        with rows. Thus the next call after Prepare(..) is always Seek(, 0).

        If Seek call succeeded and return EScan::Feed, then Feed called to pass
        data to reader. When range supplied by Seek completed then Exhausted method is
        called. Default implementation of Exhausted method return EScan::Reset,
        thus Seek method is called again with incrementing seq parameter. Also
        Feed method may return EScan::Reset indicating that current range is
        completed and next one should be set up in Seek method.

        IScan may express its desire of futher IDriver env behaviour
        with EScan codes where applicable.

        At the end IDriver calls Finish() once requesting a product. After
        this IScan is left on its own and impl. have to take care of all
        owned resources and self object in particular. It is allowed for
        IScan to return self as an IDestructable product.

        Limitations and caveats:

            1. Usage of IDriver object is not valid in contexts of any call
               of IScan iface including the initial Prepare(..).

            2. IScan has to maintain its own functional state until Finish(..)
               is called.

            3. Host env may stop progress with Finish(..) not triggered by
               IScan desires. In that case IScan may continue to work alone
               taking care of owned resources.

            4. Seek(..) will progress to Feed(..) on next wake if ::Sleep
                was requested and TLead object is left in valid state on exit
                from Seek(..). Otherwise Seek(..) will be recalled with the
                same state later.

            5. All IScan calls may be spread over time with undefined
                delays ruled by IDriver host environment. Thus IScan should
                not rely on any particular delays.

            6. It is unspecified by this inteface how IDriver activity has
                to be synchronized with IScan, left to host env design.
