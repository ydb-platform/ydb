# Ruler Configuration File
# See https://ai.intellectronica.net/ruler for documentation.

# To specify which agents are active by default when --agents is not used,
# uncomment and populate the following line. If omitted, all agents are active.
# default_agents = ["copilot", "claude"]

# Enable nested rule loading from nested .ruler directories
# When enabled, ruler will search for and process .ruler directories throughout the project hierarchy
# nested = false

# --- Agent Specific Configurations ---
# You can enable/disable agents and override their default output paths here.
# Use lowercase agent identifiers: aider, amp, claude, cline, codex, copilot, cursor, jetbrains-ai, kilocode, pi, windsurf

# [agents.copilot]
# enabled = true
# output_path = ".github/copilot-instructions.md"

# [agents.aider]
# enabled = true
# output_path_instructions = "AGENTS.md"
# output_path_config = ".aider.conf.yml"

# [agents.gemini-cli]
# enabled = true

# --- MCP Servers ---
# Define Model Context Protocol servers here. Two examples:
# 1. A stdio server (local executable)
# 2. A remote server (HTTP-based)

# [mcp_servers.example_stdio]
# command = "node"
# args = ["scripts/your-mcp-server.js"]
# env = { API_KEY = "replace_me" }

# [mcp_servers.example_remote]
# url = "https://api.example.com/mcp"
# headers = { Authorization = "Bearer REPLACE_ME" }
