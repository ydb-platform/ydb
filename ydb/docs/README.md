## Quick Start

This folder provides two scripts to help you work with the documentation locally:

### `build.sh` - Build Documentation Only

Builds the YDB documentation and outputs it to a specified directory.

```bash
# Build to a temporary directory
./build.sh

# Build to a specific directory
./build.sh /path/to/output
```

**Requirements:**
- [YFM builder](https://diplodoc.com/docs/en/tools/docs/) (`yfm` command)

**Returns:**
- Exit code 0 on successful build
- Exit code 1 on build failure

### `run.sh` - Build and Serve Documentation

Builds the documentation and starts a local HTTP server to preview the results.

```bash
# Build and serve from a temporary directory
./run.sh

# Build and serve from a specific directory
./run.sh /path/to/output
```

**Requirements:**
- [YFM builder](https://diplodoc.com/docs/en/tools/docs/) (`yfm` command)
- Python 3 (for the HTTP server)

**Access the documentation:**
- English: http://localhost:8888/en
- Russian: http://localhost:8888/ru

Press `Ctrl+C` to stop the server.

## File Structure

The documentation source files are organized as Markdown files with YAML configuration, following the Diplodoc documentation format. The built documentation includes both English (`en`) and Russian (`ru`) versions.
