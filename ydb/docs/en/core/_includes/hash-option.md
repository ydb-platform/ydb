{{ ydb-short-name }} stores user passwords in the hashed unchanged form. To keep the old password when restoring a user from a database backup, use the `HASH` option. This option uses only the hash in the JSON format to alter a user. This JSON object stores the digest of the hash function and the name of the algorithm (at the moment the [argon2id](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argon2) algorithm is used for hashing).
