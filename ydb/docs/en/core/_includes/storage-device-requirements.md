It is recommended to use physical disks (not virtual of any kind) as block devices with more than 800GB capacity for efficiency.

Minimal disk capacity must be at least 80 GB. It is recommended to use such disks only for testing, proper functioning is not guaranteed.  

Configurations with storage devices less than 800 GB are supposed for introductory purposes.

{% note warning %}

Configurations with storage devices smaller than 800 GB or virtual storage devices must not be used for services in production or for performance benchmarks.
