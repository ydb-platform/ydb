`TEMPORARY` / `TEMP` â€“ a temporary table that is automatically deleted at the end of the session. If this parameter is not set (left empty), a permanent table is created. Any indexes created on a temporary table will also be deleted at the end of the session, which means that they are temporary as well. A temporary table and a permanent table with the same name are allowed, in which case a temporary table will be selected.
