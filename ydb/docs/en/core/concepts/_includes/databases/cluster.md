## Cluster {#cluster}

_A {{ ydb-short-name }} cluster_ is a set of {{ ydb-short-name }} nodes that the load is distributed across and that communicate with each other through a network. A single cluster may host multiple databases, and specific cluster nodes are allocated for each database. One database is fully hosted in one cluster.

There are {{ ydb-short-name }} clusters with a single data center and geo-distributed clusters. The smallest single-datacenter cluster consists of a single node.
