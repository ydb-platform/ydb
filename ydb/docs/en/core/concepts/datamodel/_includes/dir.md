# Directory

For convenience, {{ ydb-short-name }} supports creating [directories](../../glossary.md#folder) similar to a filesystem, meaning the entire database consists of a directory tree, and [scheme objects](../../glossary.md#scheme-object), such as tables, are located in the leaves of this tree. A directory can host multiple subdirectories and several scheme objects. The names of scheme objects within a single directory are unique.
