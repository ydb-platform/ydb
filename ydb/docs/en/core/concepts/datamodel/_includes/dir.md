# Directory

For convenience, {{ ydb-short-name }} supports creating directories like in a file system, meaning the entire database consists of a directory tree, while tables and other entities are in the leaves of this tree (similar to files in the file system). A directory can host multiple subdirectories and tables. The names of the entities they contain are unique.
