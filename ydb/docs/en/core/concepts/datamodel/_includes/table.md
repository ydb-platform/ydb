# Table

A table in {{ ydb-short-name }} is a [relational table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_(database)) containing a set of related data and made up of rows and columns. Each row is a set of cells that are used for storing specific types of values according to the data schema. The data schema defines the names and types of table columns. An example of the data schema is shown below. The `Series` table consists of four columns named `SeriesId`, `ReleaseDate`, `SeriesInfo`, and `Title` and holding data of type `Uint64?` for the first two and `String?` for the latter two. The `SeriesId` column is declared the primary key.

![Datamodel_of_a_relational_table](../../_assets/datamodel_rtable.png)

{{ ydb-short-name }} uses [YQL](../../datatypes.md) data types. [Simple YQL data types](../../../yql/reference/types/primitive.md) can be used as column types. All columns are [optional](../../../yql/reference/types/optional.md) by default and can be assigned `NULL` values. When creating a table, you can set `NOT NULL` for columns included into the primary key. Such columns won't accept NULL in this case.

{{ ydb-short-name }} tables always have one or more columns that make up the key ([primary key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unique_key)). Each table row has a unique key value, so there can be no more than one row per key value. {{ ydb-short-name }} tables are always ordered by key. This means that you can efficiently make point reads by key and range-based queries by key or key prefix (actually using an index). In the example above, the key columns are highlighted in gray and marked with a special sign. Tables consisting only of key columns are supported. However, you can't create tables without a primary key.

Often, when you design a table schema, you already have a set of fields, which can naturally serve as the primary key. Be careful when selecting the key to avoid hotspots. For example, if you insert data into a table with a monotonically increasing key, you write the data to the end of the table. But since {{ ydb-short-name }} splits table data by key range, your inserts are always processed by the same server, so you lose the main benefits of a distributed database. To distribute the load evenly across different servers and to avoid hotspots when processing large tables, we recommend hashing the natural key and using the hash as the first component of the primary key as well as changing the order of the primary key components.

## Partitioning {#partitioning}

A database table can be sharded by primary key value ranges. Each shard of the table is responsible for a specific range of primary keys. Key ranges maintained by different shards do not overlap. Different table shards can be served by different distributed database servers (including ones in different locations). They can also move independently between servers to enable rebalancing or ensure shard operability if servers or network equipment goes offline.

If there is not a lot of data or load, the table may consist of a single shard. As the amount of data served by the shard or the load on the shard grows, {{ ydb-short-name }} automatically splits this shard into two shards. The data is split by the median value of the primary key if the shard size exceeds the threshold. If partitioning by load is used, the shard first collects a sample of the requested keys (that can be read, written, and deleted) and, based on this sample, selects a key for partitioning to evenly distribute the load across new shards. So in the case of load-based partitioning, the size of new shards may significantly vary.

The size-based shard split threshold and automatic splitting can be configured (enabled/disabled) individually for each database table.

In addition to automatically splitting shards, you can create an empty table with a predefined number of shards. You can manually set the exact shard key split range or evenly split it into a predefined number of shards. In this case, ranges are created based on the first component of the primary key. You can set even splitting for tables that have a `Uint64` or `Uint32` integer as the first component of the primary key.

Partitioning parameters refer to the table itself rather than to secondary indexes built from its data. Each index is served by its own set of shards and decisions to split or merge its partitions are made independently based on the default settings. These settings may become available to users in the future like the settings of the main table.

A split or a merge usually takes about 500 milliseconds. During this time, the data involved in the operation becomes temporarily unavailable for reads and writes. Without raising it to the application level, special wrapper methods in the {{ ydb-short-name }} SDK make automatic retries when they discover that a shard is being split or merged. Please note that if the system is overloaded for some reason (for example, due to a general shortage of CPU or insufficient DB disk throughput), split and merge operations may take longer.

The following table partitioning parameters are defined in the data schema:

#### AUTO_PARTITIONING_BY_SIZE

* Type: `Enum` (`ENABLED`, `DISABLED`).
* Default value: `ENABLED`.

Automatic partitioning by partition size. If a partition size exceeds the value specified by the [AUTO_PARTITIONING_PARTITION_SIZE_MB](#auto_partitioning_partition_size_mb) parameter, it is enqueued for splitting. If the total size of two or more adjacent partitions is less than 50% of the [AUTO_PARTITIONING_PARTITION_SIZE_MB](#auto_partitioning_partition_size_mb) value, they are enqueued for merging.

#### AUTO_PARTITIONING_BY_LOAD

* Type: `Enum` (`ENABLED`, `DISABLED`).
* Default value: `DISABLED`.

Automatic partitioning by load. If a shard consumes more than 50% of the CPU for a few dozens of seconds, it is enqueued for splitting. If the total load on two or more adjacent shards uses less than 35% of a single CPU core within an hour, they are enqueued for merging.

Performing split or merge operations uses the CPU and takes time. Therefore, when dealing with a variable load, we recommend both enabling this mode and setting [AUTO_PARTITIONING_MIN_PARTITIONS_COUNT](#auto_partitioning_min_partitions_count) to a value other than 1 so that the number of partitions doesn't drop below this value as the load decreases, and YDB doesn't have to split them again when the load is back.

When choosing the minimum number of partitions, it makes sense to consider that one table partition can only be hosted on one server and use no more than 1 CPU core for data update operations. Hence, you can set the minimum number of partitions for a table on which a high load is expected to at least the number of nodes (servers) or, preferably, to the number of CPU cores allocated to the database.

#### AUTO_PARTITIONING_PARTITION_SIZE_MB

* Type: `Uint64`.
* Default value: `2000 MB` ( `2 GB` ).

Partition size threshold in MB. If exceeded, a shard splits. Takes effect when the [AUTO_PARTITIONING_BY_SIZE](#auto_partitioning_by_size) is enabled.

#### AUTO_PARTITIONING_MIN_PARTITIONS_COUNT

* Type: `Uint64`.
* The default value is `1`.

Partitions are only merged if their actual number exceeds the value specified by this parameter. When using automatic partitioning by load, we recommend that you set this parameter to a value other than 1, so that periodic load drops don't lead to a decrease in the number of partitions below the required one.

#### AUTO_PARTITIONING_MAX_PARTITIONS_COUNT

* Type: `Uint64`.
* The default value is `50`.

Partitions are only split if their number doesn't exceed the value specified by this parameter. With any automatic partitioning mode enabled, we recommend that you set a meaningful value for this parameter and monitor when the actual number of partitions approaches this value, otherwise splitting of partitions will sooner or later stop under an increase in data or load, which will lead to a failure.

#### UNIFORM_PARTITIONS

* Type: `Uint64`.
* Default value: Not applicable

The number of partitions for uniform initial table partitioning. The primary key's first column must have type `Uint64` or `Uint32`. A created table is immediately divided into the specified number of partitions.

When automatic partitioning is enabled, make sure to set a correct value for [AUTO_PARTITIONING_MIN_PARTITIONS_COUNT](#auto_partitioning_min_partitions_count) so as not to merge all partitions into one immediately after creating the table.

#### PARTITION_AT_KEYS

* Type: `Expression`.
* Default value: Not applicable

Boundary values of keys for initial table partitioning. It's a list of boundary values separated by commas and surrounded with brackets. Each boundary value can be either a set of values of key columns (also separated by commas and surrounded with brackets) or a single value if only the values of the first key column are specified. Examples: `(100, 1000)`, `((100, "abc"), (1000, "cde"))`.

When automatic partitioning is enabled, make sure to set a correct value for [AUTO_PARTITIONING_MIN_PARTITIONS_COUNT](#auto_partitioning_min_partitions_count) so as not to merge all partitions into one immediately after creating the table.

## Reading data from replicas {#read_only_replicas}

When making queries in {{ ydb-short-name }}, the actual execution of a query to each shard is performed at a single point serving the distributed transaction protocol. By storing data in shared storage, you can run one or more shard followers without allocating additional storage space: the data is already stored in replicated format, and you can serve more than one reader (but there is still only one writer at any given moment).

Reading data from followers allows you:

* To serve clients demanding minimal delay, which is otherwise unachievable in a multi-DC cluster. This is accomplished by executing queries soon after they are formulated, which eliminates the delay associated with inter-DC transfers. As a result, you can both preserve all the storage reliability guarantees of a multi-DC cluster and respond to occasional read queries in milliseconds.
* To handle read queries from followers without affecting modifying queries running on a shard. This can be useful both for isolating different scenarios and for increasing the partition bandwidth.
* To ensuring continued service when moving a partition leader (both in a planned manner for load balancing and in an emergency). It lets the processes in the cluster survive without affecting the reading clients.
* To increasing the overall shard read performance if many read queries access the same keys.

You can enable running read replicas for each shard of the table in the table data schema. The read replicas (followers) are typically accessed without leaving the data center network, which ensures response delays in milliseconds.

| Option name | Description | Type | Acceptable values | Update<br>capability | Reset<br>capability |
| ------------- | --------- | --- | ------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------ |
| `READ_REPLICAS_SETTINGS` | `PER_AZ` means using the specified number of replicas in each AZ and `ANY_AZ` in all AZs in total. | String | `"PER_AZ:<count>"`, `"ANY_AZ:<count>"`, where `<count>` is the number of replicas | Yes | No |

The internal state of each of the followers is restored exactly and fully consistently from the leader state.

Besides the data status in storage, followers also receive a stream of updates from the leader. Updates are sent in real time, immediately after the commit to the log. However, they are sent asynchronously, resulting in some delay (usually no more than dozens of milliseconds, but sometimes longer in the event of cluster connectivity issues) in applying updates to followers relative to their commit on the leader. Therefore, reading data from followers is only supported in the`StaleReadOnly()` [transaction mode](../../transactions.md#modes).

If there are multiple followers, their delay from the leader may vary: although each follower of each of the shards retains internal consistency, artifacts may be observed from shard to shard. Please provide for this in your application code. For that same reason, it's currently impossible to perform cross-shard transactions from followers.

## Deleting expired data (TTL) {#ttl}

{{ ydb-short-name }} supports automatic background deletion of expired data. A table data schema may define a column of the [appropriate type](../../../concepts/ttl.md#restrictions). The column value for all rows will be compared with the current time in the background. Rows for which the current time becomes greater than the column value, factoring in the specified delay, will be deleted.

| Option name | Type | Acceptable values | Update<br>capability | Reset<br>capability |
| ------------- | --- | ------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------ |
| `TTL` | Expression | `Interval("<literal>") ON <column> [AS <unit>]` | Yes | Yes |

Where `<unit>`:
* `SECONDS`;
* `MILLISECONDS`;
* `MICROSECONDS`;
* `NANOSECONDS`.

For more information about deleting expired data, see [Time to Live (TTL)](../../../concepts/ttl.md).

## Renaming {#rename}

{{ ydb-short-name }} lets you rename an existing table, move it to another directory of the same database, or replace one table with another, deleting the data in the replaced table. Only the metadata of the table is changed by operations (for example, its path and name). The table data is neither moved nor overwritten.

Operations are performed in isolation, the external process sees only two states of the table: before and after the operation. This is critical, for example, for table replacement: the data of the replaced table is deleted by the same transaction that renames the replacing table. During the replacement, there might be errors in queries to the replaced table that have [retryable statuses](../../../reference/ydb-sdk/error_handling.md#termination-statuses).

The speed of renaming is determined by the type of data transactions currently running against the table and doesn't depend on the table size.

* [Renaming a table via the CLI](../../../reference/ydb-cli/commands/tools/rename.md)

## Bloom filter {#bloom-filter}

With a [Bloom filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter), you can more efficiently determine if some keys are missing in a table when making multiple single queries by the primary key. This reduces the number of required disk I/O operations but increases the amount of memory consumed.

| Option name | Type | Acceptable values | Update<br>capability | Reset<br>capability |
| ------------- | --- | ------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------ |
| `KEY_BLOOM_FILTER` | Enum | `ENABLED`, `DISABLED` | Yes | No |

## Column groups {#column-groups}

You can group table columns to optimize their storage and use in {{ ydb-short-name }}. Column grouping enables you to improve the performance of data selections by introducing grouped column storage. The most commonly used strategy is to create a separate column group for rarely used attributes (possibly also with compression and on a slower storage).

Each column group has a unique name within a table. You can set the composition of column groups when [creating a table](../../../yql/reference/syntax/create_table.md#column-family) and [change](../../../yql/reference/syntax/alter_table.md#column-family) it later. You cannot remove column groups from an existing table.

A column family may contain any number of columns of its table, including none. Each table column can belong to a single column group (that is, column groups can't overlap). Column groups are set up when creating a table, but can be modified later.

Each table has a `default` column group that includes all the columns that don't belong to any other column group. Primary-key columns are always in the default column group and can't be moved to another group.

Column groups are assigned attributes that affect data storage:

* The type of the data storage device used (SSD or HDD, availability depends on the {{ ydb-short-name }} cluster configuration).
* Data compression mode (without compression or compression using the [LZ4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LZ4) algorithm).

Attributes for a column group are set when creating a table (for example, they can be explicitly set for a default column group) and changed afterwards. Changes in storage attributes aren't applied to the data immediately, but later, at manual or automatic LSM compaction.

The data stored in the fields of the default column group is accessed faster: this requires less resources than accessing the fields from additional column groups of the same table row. When you search by the primary key, the default column group is always used. When accessing fields from other column groups, besides searching by the primary key, you need additional search operations to determine specific storage positions for these fields.

This way, by creating a separate column group for certain table columns, you can accelerate read operations for the most important frequently used columns of the default column group by slightly slowing down access to other columns. Furthermore, at the column group level, you can control the data storage parameters: for example, you can select the storage device type and data compression mode.

## Custom attributes {#users-attr}

By using custom attributes, you can add any data to your table metadata. This data isn't interpreted by the server, but it can be used by a DB client (a human or, most frequently, a program).

The attributes are key-value pairs. As the attribute keys and values, you can only use strings or other data types that can be cast into strings (for example, using BASE64 encoding).

The following restrictions apply to keys and values of custom attributes:

* Key length: 1–100 bytes.
* Value length: 1–4096 bytes.
* The maximum total attribute size (a total length of all keys and values): 10,240 bytes.

To learn how to add, edit, or get the current values of attributes or drop attributes, see [{#T}](../../../operations/manage-users-attr.md).
