Additionally, ensure network access from the {{ ydb-short-name }} dynamic nodes to the external data source (at the address specified in the `LOCATION` parameter of the `CREATE EXTERNAL DATA SOURCE` request). If network connection encryption to the external source was enabled in the previous step, the connector will use the system's root certificates. More details on TLS configuration can be found in the [guide](../../../devops/deployment-options/manual/federated-queries/connector-deployment.md) on deploying the connector.
