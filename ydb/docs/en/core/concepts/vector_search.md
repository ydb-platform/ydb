# Vector search

## Concept of vector search

**Vector search**, also known as [nearest neighbor search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nearest_neighbor_search) (NN), is an optimization problem where the goal is to find the nearest vector (or a set of vectors) in a given dataset relative to a specified query vector. The proximity between vectors is determined using distance or similarity metrics.

Vector search is actively used in the following areas:

* recommendation systems
* semantic search
* search for similar images
* anomaly detection
* classification systems

In addition, **vector search** in {{ ydb-short-name }} is widely applied in machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) tasks. It is particularly useful in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches, which utilize vector search to retrieve relevant information from large volumes of data, significantly enhancing the quality of generative models.

Methods for solving vector search tasks can be divided into three major categories:

* [exact methods](#vector-search-exact)
* [approximate methods without index](#vector-search-approximate)
* [approximate methods with index](#vector-search-index)

The choice of a method depends on the number of vectors and the nature of the workload. Exact methods search slowly but update quickly, whereas indexes do the opposite.

## Approximate vector search with index {#vector-search-index}

When the data volume significantly increases, non-index approaches cease to work within acceptable time limits. In such cases, additional data structures are necessary such as [vector indexes](../dev/vector-indexes.md), which accelerate the search process.

Main advantage:

* ability to work with a large number of vectors

Disadvantages:

* index construction may take considerable time
* in the current version, data modification operations such as insertion, update, and deletion are not supported
