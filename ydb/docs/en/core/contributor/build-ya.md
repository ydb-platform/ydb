# Build and test YDB using Ya Make

**Ya Make** is a build and test system used historically for YDB development. Initially designed for C++, now it supports number of programming languages including Java, Go, and Python.

**Ya Make** build configuration language is a primary one for YDB, with a `ya.make` file in each directory representing Ya Make targets.

Setup the development environment as described in [Working on a change - Setup environment](suggest-change.md) arcticle to work with `Ya Make`.

## Running Ya commands {#run_ya}

There's a `ya` script in the YDB repository root to run `Ya Make` commands from the console. You can add it to the PATH evniromnet variable to enable launching without specifiying a full path. For Linux/Bash and GitHub repo cloned to `~/ydbwork/ydb` you can use the following command:

```bash
echo "alias ya='~/ydbwork/ydb/ya'" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

Run `ya` without parameters to get help:

```bash
$ ya
Yet another build tool.

Usage: ya [--precise] [--profile] [--error-file ERROR_FILE] [--keep-tmp] [--no-logs] [--no-report] [--no-tmp-dir] [--print-path] [--version] [-v] [--diag] [--help] <SUBCOMMAND> [OPTION]...

Options:
...

Available subcommands:
...
```

You can get detailed help on any subcommand launching it with a `--help` flag, for instance:

```bash
$ ya make --help
Build and run tests
To see more help use -hh/-hhh

Usage:
  ya make [OPTION]... [TARGET]...

Examples:
  ya make -r               Build current directory in release mode
  ya make -t -j16 library  Build and test library with 16 threads
  ya make --checkout -j0   Checkout absent directories without build

Options:
...
```

The `ya` script downloads required platform-specific artifacts when started, and caches them locally. Periodically, the script is updated with the links to the new versions of the artifacts.

## Setup IDE {#ide}

If you're using IDE for development, there's a command `ya ide` which helps you create a project with configured tools. The following IDEs are supported: goland, idea, pycharm, venv, vscode (multilanguage, clangd, go, py).

Go to the directory in the source code which you need to be a root of your project. Run the `ya ide` command specifying the IDE name, and the target directory to write the IDE project configuration in a `-P` parameter. For instance, to work on the YQL library changes in vscode you can run the following command:

```bash
cd ~/ydbwork/ydb/library/yql
ya ide vscode -P=~/ydbwork/vscode/yqllib
```

Now you can open the `~/ydbwork/vscode/yqllib/ide.code-workspace` from vscode.

## Build a target {#make}

There are 3 basic types of targets in `Ya Make`: Program, Test, and Library. To build a target run `ya make` with the directory name. For instance, to build a YDB CLI run:

```bash
cd ~/ydbwork/ydb
ya make ydb/apps/ydb
```

You can also run `ya make` from inside a target directory without parameters:

```bash
cd ~/ydbwork/ydb/ydb/apps/ydb
ya make
```

## Run tests {#test}

Running a `ya test` command in some directory will build all test binaries located inside its subdirectories, and start tests.

For instance, to run YDB Core small tests run:

```bash
cd ~/ydbwork/ydb
ya test ydb/core
```

To run medium and large tests, add options `-tt` and `-ttt` to the `ya test` call, respectively.
