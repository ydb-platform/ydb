# Deploying {{ ydb-short-name }} with Federated Query functionality

{% note warning %}

This functionality is in "Experimental" mode.

{% endnote %}

## General installation scheme{#general-scheme}

{{ ydb-full-name }} can perform [federated queries](../../concepts/federated_query/index.md) to external sources (e.g., object storages or relational DBMS) without the need to move their data directly into {{ ydb-short-name }}. This section will discuss the changes needed in the configuration of {{ ydb-short-name }} and the surrounding infrastructure to enable federated query functionality.

{% note info %}

A special microservice called [connector](../../concepts/federated_query/architecture.md#connectors) must be deployed to access some of data sources. Check the [list of supported sources](../../concepts/federated_query/architecture.md#supported-datasources) to determine if you need to install a connector.

{% endnote %}

The {{ ydb-short-name }} cluster and external data sources in a production installation should be deployed on different physical or virtual servers, including clouds. If access to a specific source requires a connector, it should be deployed on the same servers as the dynamic nodes of {{ ydb-short-name }}. In other words, each `ydbd` process running in dynamic node mode should have one local connector process.

The following requirements must be met:
* The external data source must be accessible over the network for queries from {{ ydb-short-name }} or from the connector (if present);
* The connector must be accessible over the network for queries from {{ ydb-short-name }} (which is trivially achieved by running these processes on the same host).

Currently, we do not support deploying the connector in {{ k8s }}, but we plan to add it shortly.

## Step-by-step guide

1. Follow the steps in the dynamic node {{ ydb-short-name }} deployment guide up to and including [preparing the configuration files](./deploy-ydb-on-premises.md#config).
2. If a connector must be deployed to access the desired source, do so [according to the instructions](./connector.md).
3. If a connector needs to be deployed to access your desired source, add a `generic` subsection in the `query_service_config` section of the {{ ydb-short-name }} configuration file as shown below. Specify the network address of the connector in the `connector.endpoint.host` and `connector.endpoint.port` fields (default `localhost` and `2130`). When co-locating the connector and the {{ ydb-short-name }} dynamic node on the same server, encrypted connections between them are *not required*, but if necessary, you can enable encryption by setting `connector.use_ssl` to `true` and specifying the path to the CA certificate used to sign the connector's TLS keys in `connector.ssl_ca_crt`:
    ```yaml
    query_service_config:
        generic:
            connector:
                endpoint:
                    host: localhost                 # hostname where the connector is deployed
                    port: 2130                      # port number for the connector's listening socket
                use_ssl: false                      # flag to enable encrypted connections
                ssl_ca_crt: "/opt/ydb/certs/ca.crt" # (optional) path to the CA certificate
            default_settings:
                - name: DateTimeFormat
                  value: string
                - name: UsePredicatePushdown
                  value: "true"
    ```
4. Add the following `feature_flags` section to the {{ ydb-short-name }} configuration file:
    ```yaml
    feature_flags:
        enable_external_data_sources: true
        enable_script_execution_operations: true
    ```
5. Continue deploying the dynamic node {{ ydb-short-name }} according to the [instructions](./deploy-ydb-on-premises.md).
