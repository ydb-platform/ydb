# System requirements and recommendations

This section provides recommendations for deploying {{ ydb-short-name }}.

## Hardware configuration {#hardware}

* **CPU**

  {{ ydb-short-name }} server can be run only on x86-64 CPU with AVX2 instructions support (Intel Haswell (4th generation) and later, AMD EPYC and later).
  ARM processors are not supported now.

* **Memory**

  It is recommended to use error-correcting code (ECC) memory for data consistency.

* **Storage**

  {{ ydb-short-name }} server can be run on servers with any storage types (HDD/SSD/NVMe/RAM). It is recommended to use SSD/NVMe drives for better performance.

  {% include [_includes/storage-device-requirements.md](../_includes/storage-device-requirements.md) %}

  {{ ydb-short-name }} does not use any filesystems to store data and works  directly with disk. Don't create or mount filesystems on disks which are used in {{ ydb-short-name }} . Also it is not recommended to share block devices with other processes as this can lead to a significant performance degradation.


## Software configuration {#software}

{{ ydb-short-name }} server can be run on OS Linux with kernel 4.4 or later. MacOS and Windows are not supported now.

## Topology {#topology}

When planning a deployment, it's important to choose the right [Blob Storage configuration](./configuration/config.md#domains-blob) based on the required fault tolerance:

 * Mode None - This mode requires 1 server without fault tolerance. It is recommended only for functional testing.

 * block-4-2: This mode requires at least 8 servers in one datacenter. To ensure maximum fault tolerance, servers must be located in 8 independent racks. In this mode cluster remains operational if 1 rack fails completely and 1 node in another rack fails.

 * Mode mirror-3dc - This mode requires at least 9 servers. To ensure maximum fault tolerance, servers must be located in three independent data centers and different server racks in each of them. In this mode cluster remains operational if 1 datacenter fails completely and 1 node fails in another datacenter.

  * Mode mirror-3dc - This mode requires at least 9 servers. To ensure maximum fault tolerance, servers must be located in three independent data centers and different server racks in each of them. In this mode cluster remains operational if 1 datacenter fails completely and 1 node fails in another datacenter.

  * Mode mirror-3dc-3-nodes - The simple variant of mirror-3dc mode. This mode requires at least 3 servers with 3 disks in each. To ensure maximum fault tolerance, each server must be located in an independent datacenter. In this mode cluster keeps running if no more than 1 node fails. It is recommended only for testing.

The failure of the node means that the server is out of service completely or one of the disks in it fails.
