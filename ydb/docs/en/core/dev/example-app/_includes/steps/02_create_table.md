## Creating tables {#create-table}

Create tables to be used in operations on a test app. This step results in the creation of database tables for the series directory data model:

- `Series`
- `Seasons`
- `Episodes`

After the tables are created, a method for retrieving information about data schema objects is called, and the result of its execution is displayed.
