# App in Java

This page contains a detailed description of the code of a [test app](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb-java-examples/tree/master/query-example) that is available as part of the {{ ydb-short-name }} [Java SDK Examples](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb-java-examples).

## Downloading SDK Examples and running the example {#download}

The following execution scenario is based on [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.html).

Create a working directory and use it to run from the command line the command to clone the GitHub repository:

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb-java-examples
```

Then build the SDK Examples

``` bash
mvn package -f ./ydb-java-examples
```

Next, from the same working directory, run the command to start the test app. The command will differ depending on the database to connect to.

{% include [run_options.md](_includes/run_options.md) %}

{% include [init.md](../_includes/steps/01_init.md) %}

Main driver initialization parameters
* A connection string containing details about an [endpoint](../../../concepts/connect.md#endpoint) and [database](../../../concepts/connect.md#database). This is the only parameter that is required.
* [Authentication](../../../recipes/ydb-sdk/auth.md#auth-provider) provider. Unless explicitly specified, an [anonymous connection](../../../concepts/auth.md) is used.
* [Session pool](../../../recipes/ydb-sdk/session-pool-limit.md) settings

App code snippet for driver initialization:

```java
this.transport = GrpcTransport.forConnectionString(connectionString)
        .withAuthProvider(CloudAuthHelper.getAuthProviderFromEnviron())
        .build();
this.queryClient = QueryClient.newClient(transport).build();
```

It is also [recommended] (../../../recipes/ydb-sdk/retry.md) to use the `SessionRetryContext` helper class for execution of operations with the YDB: it ensures proper retries in case the database becomes partially unavailable. Sample code to initialize the retry context:

```java
this.retryCtx = SessionRetryContext.create(queryClient).build();
```

{% include [create_table.md](../_includes/steps/02_create_table.md) %}

To create tables, use the `TxMode.NONE` transaction mode, which allows the execution of DDL queries:

```java
private void createTables() {
    retryCtx.supplyResult(session -> session.createQuery(""
            + "CREATE TABLE series ("
            + "  series_id UInt64,"
            + "  title Text,"
            + "  series_info Text,"
            + "  release_date Date,"
            + "  PRIMARY KEY(series_id)"
            + ")", TxMode.NONE).execute()
    ).join().getStatus().expectSuccess("Can't create table series");

    retryCtx.supplyResult(session -> session.createQuery(""
            + "CREATE TABLE seasons ("
            + "  series_id UInt64,"
            + "  season_id UInt64,"
            + "  title Text,"
            + "  first_aired Date,"
            + "  last_aired Date,"
            + "  PRIMARY KEY(series_id, season_id)"
            + ")", TxMode.NONE).execute()
    ).join().getStatus().expectSuccess("Can't create table seasons");

    retryCtx.supplyResult(session -> session.createQuery(""
            + "CREATE TABLE episodes ("
            + "  series_id UInt64,"
            + "  season_id UInt64,"
            + "  episode_id UInt64,"
            + "  title Text,"
            + "  air_date Date,"
            + "  PRIMARY KEY(series_id, season_id, episode_id)"
            + ")", TxMode.NONE).execute()
    ).join().getStatus().expectSuccess("Can't create table episodes");
}
```

{% include [../steps/03_write_queries.md](../_includes/steps/03_write_queries.md) %}

To execute YQL queries, use the `QuerySession.createQuery()` method. It creates a new `QueryStream` object, which allows to execute a query and subscribe for receiving response data from the server. Because write requests don't expect any results, the `QueryStream.execute()` method is used without parameters; it just executes the request and waits for the stream to complete.
Code snippet demonstrating this logic:

```java
private void upsertSimple() {
    String query
            = "UPSERT INTO episodes (series_id, season_id, episode_id, title) "
            + "VALUES (2, 6, 1, \"TBD\");";

    // Executes data query with specified transaction control settings.
    retryCtx.supplyResult(session -> session.createQuery(query, TxMode.SERIALIZABLE_RW).execute())
        .join().getValue();
```

{% include [steps/04_query_processing.md](../_includes/steps/04_query_processing.md) %}

Direct usage of the `QueryStream` class to obtain results may not always be convenient, as it involves receiving data from the server asynchronously in the callback of the `QueryStream.execute()` method. If the number of expected rows in a result is not too large, it is more practical to use the `QueryReader` helper from the SDK, which first reads all response parts from the stream and provides them all to the user in an ordered form.

```java
private void selectSimple() {
    String query
            = "SELECT series_id, title, release_date "
            + "FROM series WHERE series_id = 1;";

    // Executes data query with specified transaction control settings.
    QueryReader result = retryCtx.supplyResult(
            session -> QueryReader.readFrom(session.createQuery(query, TxMode.SERIALIZABLE_RW))
    ).join().getValue();

    logger.info("--[ SelectSimple ]--");

    ResultSetReader rs = result.getResultSet(0);
    while (rs.next()) {
        logger.info("read series with id {}, title {} and release_date {}",
                rs.getColumn("series_id").getUint64(),
                rs.getColumn("title").getText(),
                rs.getColumn("release_date").getDate()
        );
    }
}
```

As a result of the query, an object of the `QueryReader` class is generated. It may contain several sets obtained using the `getResultSet( <index> )` method. Since there was only one `SELECT` statement in the query, the result contains only one selection indexed as `0`. The given code snippet prints the following text to the console at startup:


```bash
12:06:36.548 INFO  App - --[ SelectSimple ]--
12:06:36.559 INFO  App - read series with id 1, title IT Crowd and release_date 2006-02-03
```

{% include [param_queries.md](../_includes/steps/06_param_queries.md) %}

The code snippet below demonstrates how to use parameterized queries and the `Params` class to construct parameters and pass them to the `QuerySession.createQuery` method.

```java
private void selectWithParams(long seriesID, long seasonID) {
    String query
            = "DECLARE $seriesId AS Uint64; "
            + "DECLARE $seasonId AS Uint64; "
            + "SELECT sa.title AS season_title, sr.title AS series_title "
            + "FROM seasons AS sa INNER JOIN series AS sr ON sa.series_id = sr.series_id "
            + "WHERE sa.series_id = $seriesId AND sa.season_id = $seasonId";

    // Begin new transaction with SerializableRW mode
    TxControl txControl = TxControl.serializableRw().setCommitTx(true);

    // Type of parameter values should be exactly the same as in DECLARE statements.
    Params params = Params.of(
            "$seriesId", PrimitiveValue.newUint64(seriesID),
            "$seasonId", PrimitiveValue.newUint64(seasonID)
    );

    DataQueryResult result = retryCtx.supplyResult(session -> session.executeDataQuery(query, txControl, params))
            .join().getValue();

    logger.info("--[ SelectWithParams ] -- ");

    ResultSetReader rs = result.getResultSet(0);
    while (rs.next()) {
        logger.info("read season with title {} for series {}",
                rs.getColumn("season_title").getText(),
                rs.getColumn("series_title").getText()
        );
    }
}
```

{% include [async_requests.md](../_includes/steps/11_async_requests.md) %}

If the expected row count in the response is large, asynchronous reading is the preferred way to process them. In this case, the `SessionRetryContext` is still used for retries because processing response parts can be interrupted at any moment, requiring the entire execution process to restart.

```java
private void asyncSelectRead(long seriesID, long seasonID) {
    String query
            = "DECLARE $seriesId AS Uint64; "
            + "DECLARE $seasonId AS Uint64; "
            + "SELECT ep.title AS episode_title, sa.title AS season_title, sr.title AS series_title "
            + "FROM episodes AS ep "
            + "JOIN seasons AS sa ON sa.season_id = ep.season_id "
            + "JOIN series AS sr ON sr.series_id = sa.series_id "
            + "WHERE sa.series_id = $seriesId AND sa.season_id = $seasonId;";

    // Type of parameter values should be exactly the same as in DECLARE statements.
    Params params = Params.of(
            "$seriesId", PrimitiveValue.newUint64(seriesID),
            "$seasonId", PrimitiveValue.newUint64(seasonID)
    );

    logger.info("--[ ExecuteAsyncQueryWithParams ]--");
    retryCtx.supplyResult(session -> {
        QueryStream asyncQuery = session.createQuery(query, TxMode.SNAPSHOT_RO, params);
        return asyncQuery.execute(part -> {
            ResultSetReader rs = part.getResultSetReader();
            logger.info("read {} rows of result set {}", rs.getRowCount(), part.getResultSetIndex());
            while (rs.next()) {
                logger.info("read episode {} of {} for {}",
                        rs.getColumn("episode_title").getText(),
                        rs.getColumn("season_title").getText(),
                        rs.getColumn("series_title").getText()
                );
            }
        });
    }).join().getStatus().expectSuccess("execute query problem");
}
```

{% include [multistep_transactions.md](../_includes/steps/09_multistep_transactions.md) %}

To ensure interoperability between the transactions and the retry context, each transaction must wholly execute inside the callback passed to `SessionRetryContext`. The callback must return after the entire transaction is completed.

Code template for running complex transactions inside `SessionRetryContext`
```java
private void multiStepTransaction(long seriesID, long seasonID) {
    retryCtx.supplyStatus(session -> {
        QueryTransaction transaction = session.createNewTransaction(TxMode.SNAPSHOT_RO);

        //...

        return CompletableFuture.completedFuture(Status.SUCCESS);
    }).join().expectSuccess("multistep transaction problem");
}
```

The first step is to prepare and execute the first query:

```java
    String query1
            = "DECLARE $seriesId AS Uint64; "
            + "DECLARE $seasonId AS Uint64; "
            + "SELECT MIN(first_aired) AS from_date FROM seasons "
            + "WHERE series_id = $seriesId AND season_id = $seasonId;";

    // Execute the first query to start a new transaction
    QueryReader res1 = QueryReader.readFrom(transaction.createQuery(query1, Params.of(
            "$seriesId", PrimitiveValue.newUint64(seriesID),
            "$seasonId", PrimitiveValue.newUint64(seasonID)
    ))).join().getValue();
```

After that, we can process the resulting data on the client side:

```java
    // Perform some client logic on returned values
    ResultSetReader resultSet = res1.getResultSet(0);
    if (!resultSet.next()) {
        throw new RuntimeException("not found first_aired");
    }
    LocalDate fromDate = resultSet.getColumn("from_date").getDate();
    LocalDate toDate = fromDate.plusDays(15);
```

And get the current `transaction id` to continue processing within the same transaction:

```java
    // Get active transaction id
    logger.info("started new transaction {}", transaction.getId());
```

The next step is to create the next query that uses the results of code execution on the client side:

```java
    // Construct next query based on the results of client logic
    String query2
            = "DECLARE $seriesId AS Uint64;"
            + "DECLARE $fromDate AS Date;"
            + "DECLARE $toDate AS Date;"
            + "SELECT season_id, episode_id, title, air_date FROM episodes "
            + "WHERE series_id = $seriesId AND air_date >= $fromDate AND air_date <= $toDate;";

    // Execute the second query and commit
    QueryReader res2 = QueryReader.readFrom(transaction.createQueryWithCommit(query2, Params.of(
        "$seriesId", PrimitiveValue.newUint64(seriesID),
        "$fromDate", PrimitiveValue.newDate(fromDate),
        "$toDate", PrimitiveValue.newDate(toDate)
    ))).join().getValue();

    logger.info("--[ MultiStep ]--");
    ResultSetReader rs = res2.getResultSet(0);
    while (rs.next()) {
        logger.info("read episode {} with air date {}",
                rs.getColumn("title").getText(),
                rs.getColumn("air_date").getDate()
        );
    }
```

The given code snippets output the following text to the console at startup:

```bash
12:06:36.850 INFO  App - --[ MultiStep ]--
12:06:36.851 INFO  App - read episode Grow Fast or Die Slow with air date 2018-03-25

```

{% include [transaction_control.md](../_includes/steps/10_transaction_control.md) %}

Code snippet for `beginTransaction()` and `transaction.commit()` calls:

```java
private void tclTransaction() {
    retryCtx.supplyResult(session -> {
        QueryTransaction transaction = session.beginTransaction(TxMode.SERIALIZABLE_RW)
            .join().getValue();

        String query
                = "DECLARE $airDate AS Date; "
                + "UPDATE episodes SET air_date = $airDate WHERE title = \"TBD\";";

        Params params = Params.of("$airDate", PrimitiveValue.newDate(Instant.now()));

        // Execute data query.
        // Transaction control settings continues active transaction (tx)
        QueryReader reader = QueryReader.readFrom(transaction.createQuery(query, params))
            .join().getValue();

        logger.info("get transaction {}", transaction.getId());

        // Commit active transaction (tx)
        return transaction.commit();
    }).join().getStatus().expectSuccess("tcl transaction problem");
}
```
