# Database system views

To obtain service information about the state of the database, you can access system views. They are accessible from the root of the database tree and use the system path prefix `.sys`.

{% note info %}

Frequent access to system views leads to additional load on the database, especially in the case of a large database size. Exceeding the frequency of 1 request per second is not recommended.

{% endnote %}

## Partitions {#partitions}

The following system view stores detailed information about [partitions](../concepts/datamodel/table.md#partitioning) of DB tables:

* `partition_stats`: Contains information about instant metrics and cumulative operation counters. Instant metrics are, for example, CPU load or count of in-flight [transactions](../concepts/transactions.md). Cumulative counters, for example, count the total number of rows read.

The system view is designed to detect various irregularities in the load on a table partition or show the size of table partition data.

Instant metrics (`NodeID`, `AccessTime`, `CPUCores`, etc.) contain instantaneous values.
Cumulative metrics (`RowReads`, `RowUpdate`, `LockAcquired`, etc.) store accumulated values since the last launch (`StartTime`) of the tablet serving the partition.

The following system views store data for analyzing the user queries.

Maximum total execution time:

* `top_queries_by_duration_one_minute`: data is split into one-minute intervals, contains the history for the last 6 hours;
* `top_queries_by_duration_one_hour`: data is split into one-hour intervals, contains the history for the last 2 weeks.

Each table row contains information about a set of queries with identical text that were made during one minute. The table fields provide the minimum, maximum, and total values for each query metric tracked. Within the interval, queries are sorted in descending order of the total CPU time used.

Restrictions:

* Query text limit is 10 KB.

    MinReadBytes,
    SumReadBytes / Count as AvgReadBytes,
    MaxReadBytes,
    QueryText

WHERE SumReadBytes > 0
ORDER BY IntervalEnd DESC, SumReadBytes DESC
LIMIT 100
```

## History of overloaded partitions {#top-overload-partitions}

The following system views (tables) store the history of points in time when the load on individual DB table partitions was high:

* `top_partitions_one_minute`: The data is split into one-minute intervals, contains the history for the last 6 hours.
* `top_partitions_one_hour`: The data is split into one-hour intervals, contains the history for the last 2 weeks.

These views contain partitions with peak loads of more than 70% (`CPUCores` > 0.7). Partitions within a single interval are ranked by peak load value.

The keys of the views are:

* `IntervalEnd` - the moment when the interval is closed;
* `Rank` - the rank of the partition according to the peak load of `CPUCores` in this interval.

For example, if a table has 10 partitions than `top_partitions_one_hour` for the hour interval `"20.12.2024 10:00-11:00"` will return 10 rows sorted in descending order of `CPUCores`. They will have a `Rank` from 1 to 10 and the same `IntervalEnd` `"20.12.2024 11:00"`.

All tables have the same structure:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `IntervalEnd` | The end of the minute or hour interval for which statistics are collected.<br/>Type: `Timestamp`.<br/>Key: `0`. |
| `Rank` | Partition rank within an interval (by `CPUCores`).<br/>Type: `Uint32`.<br/>Key: `1`. |
| `TabletId` | ID of the tablet serving the partition.<br/>Type: `Uint64`. |
| `FollowerId` | ID of the partition tablet [follower](../concepts/glossary.md#tablet-follower).A value of 0 means the leader.<br/>Type: `Uint32` |
| `Path` | Full path to the table.<br/>Type: `Utf8`. |
| `PeakTime` | Peak time within an interval.<br/>Type: `Timestamp`. |
| `CPUCores` | Peak load per partition (share of the CPU core time spent by the actor of the partition).<br/>Type: `Double`. |
| `NodeId` | ID of the node where the partition was located during the peak load.<br/>Type: `Uint32`. |
| `DataSize` | Approximate partition size, in bytes, during the peak load.<br/>Type: `Uint64`. |
| `RowCount` | Approximate row count during the peak load.<br/>Type: `Uint64`. |
| `IndexSize` | Partition index size per tablet during the peak load.<br/>Type: `Uint64`. |
| `InFlightTxCount` | The number of in-flight transactions during the peak load.<br/>Type: `Uint32`. |

### Example queries {#top-overload-partitions-examples}

The following query returns partitions with CPU usage of more than 70% in the specified interval, with tablet IDs and sizes as of the time when the percentage was exceeded. The query is made to the `.sys/top_partitions_one_minute` view:

```yql
SELECT
   IntervalEnd,
   CPUCores,
   Path,
   TabletId,
   DataSize
FROM `.sys/top_partitions_one_minute`
WHERE CPUCores > 0.7
AND IntervalEnd BETWEEN Timestamp("2000-01-01T00:00:00Z") AND Timestamp("2099-12-31T00:00:00Z")
ORDER BY IntervalEnd desc, CPUCores desc
```

The following query returns partitions with CPU usage of over 90% in the specified interval, with tablet IDs and sizes as of the time when the percentage was exceeded. The query is made to the `.sys/top_partitions_one_hour` view:

```yql
SELECT
   IntervalEnd,
   CPUCores,
   Path,
   TabletId,
   DataSize
FROM `.sys/top_partitions_one_hour`
WHERE CPUCores > 0.9
AND IntervalEnd BETWEEN Timestamp("2000-01-01T00:00:00Z") AND Timestamp("2099-12-31T00:00:00Z")
ORDER BY IntervalEnd desc, CPUCores desc
```

## History of partitions with broken locks {#top-tli-partitions}

The following system views contain a history of moments with a non-zero number of broken [locks](../contributor/datashard-locks-and-change-visibility.md) `LocksBroken` in individual partitions of DB tables:

* `top_partitions_by_tli_one_minute`: The data is split into one-minute intervals, contains the history for the last 6 hours.
* `top_partitions_by_tli_one_hour`: The data is split into one-hour intervals, contains the history for the last 2 weeks.

The views provide the top 10 partitions with a non-zero number of broken locks `LocksBroken`. Within a single interval, partitions are ranked by the number of broken locks `LocksBroken`.

The keys of the views are:

* `IntervalEnd` - the moment of interval closure;
* `Rank` - the rank of the partition by the number of broken locks `LocksBroken` in this interval.

For example, `top_partitions_by_tli_one_hour` for the hourly interval `"20.12.2024 10:00-11:00"` will output 10 rows, sorted in descending order by `LocksBroken`. They will have `Rank` from 1 to 10 and the same `IntervalEnd` `"20.12.2024 11:00"`.

All tables have the same structure:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `IntervalEnd` | The end of the minute or hour interval for which statistics are collected.<br/>Type: `Timestamp`.<br/>Key: `0`. |
| `Rank` | Partition rank within an interval (by `CPUCores`).<br/>Type: `Uint32`.<br/>Key: `1`. |
| `TabletId` | ID of the tablet serving the partition.<br/>Type: `Uint64`. |
| `FollowerId` | ID of the partition tablet [follower](../concepts/glossary.md#tablet-follower).A value of 0 means the leader.<br/>Type: `Uint32` |
| `Path` | Full path to the table.<br/>Type: `Utf8`. |
| `LocksAcquired` | Number of locks acquired "on a range of keys" in this interval.<br />Type: `Uint64`. |
| `LocksWholeShard` | Number of locks acquired "on the entire partition" in this interval.<br />Type: `Uint64`. |
| `LocksBroken` | Number of broken locks in this interval.<br />Type: `Uint64`. |
| `NodeId` | ID of the node where the partition was located during the peak load.<br/>Type: `Uint32`. |
| `DataSize` | Approximate partition size, in bytes, during the peak load.<br/>Type: `Uint64`. |
| `RowCount` | Approximate row count during the peak load.<br/>Type: `Uint64`. |
| `IndexSize` | Partition index size per tablet during the peak load.<br/>Type: `Uint64`. |

### Example queries {#top-tli-partitions-examples}

    Path,
    TabletId
FROM `.sys/top_partitions_by_tli_one_hour`
WHERE IntervalEnd BETWEEN Timestamp("2000-01-01T00:00:00Z") AND Timestamp("2099-12-31T00:00:00Z")
ORDER BY IntervalEnd desc, LocksBroken desc
```
