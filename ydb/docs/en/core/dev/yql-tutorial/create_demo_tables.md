```yql
CREATE TABLE series         -- series is the table name.
(                           -- Must be unique within the folder.
    series_id Uint64,
    title Utf8,
    series_info Utf8,
    release_date Uint64,
    PRIMARY KEY (series_id) -- The primary key is a column or
                            -- combination of columns that uniquely identifies
                            -- each table row (contains only
                            -- non-repeating values). A table can have
                            -- only one primary key. For every table
                            -- in YDB, the primary key is required.
