# Joining tables with JOIN

Merge the columns of the source tables `seasons` and `series`, then output all the seasons of the IT Crowd series to the resulting table using the [JOIN](../../yql/reference/syntax/join.md) operator.

{% include [yql-reference-prerequisites](_includes/yql_tutorial_prerequisites.md) %}

```sql
SELECT
    sa.title AS season_title,    -- sa and sr are "join names",
    sr.title AS series_title,    -- table aliases declared below using AS.
    sr.series_id,                -- They are used to avoid
    sa.season_id                 -- ambiguity in the column names used.

FROM
    seasons AS sa
INNER JOIN
    series AS sr
ON sa.series_id = sr.series_id
WHERE sa.series_id = 1
ORDER BY                         -- Sorting of the results.
    sr.series_id,
    sa.season_id                 -- ORDER BY sorts the values by one column
;                                -- or multiple columns. 
                                 -- Columns are separated by commas.

COMMIT;
