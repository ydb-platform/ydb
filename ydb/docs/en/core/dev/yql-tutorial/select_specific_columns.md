# Selecting data from specific columns

Select the data from the columns `series_id`, `release_date`, and `title`. At the same time, rename `title` to `series_title` and cast the type of `release_date` from `Uint32` to `Date`.

```yql
SELECT
    series_id,             -- The names of columns (series_id, release_date, title)
                           -- are separated by commas.

    title AS series_title, -- You can use AS to rename columns
                           -- or give a name to an arbitrary expression

    CAST(release_date AS Date) AS release_date

FROM series;

COMMIT;
