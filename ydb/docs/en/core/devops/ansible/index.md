# Working with {{ ydb-short-name }} using Ansible

This section of {{ ydb-short-name }} documentation contains a collection of articles intended for DevOps engineers managing {{ ydb-short-name }} clusters using [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/). This is the recommended approach to running production {{ ydb-short-name }} clusters directly on virtual machines or bare metal. It is recommended to use [Kubernetes](../kubernetes/index.md) instead of Ansible for containerized environments.

The key articles to get started with this section:

* [Initial deployment](initial-deployment.md)
* [Preparing VMs with Terraform](preparing-vms-with-terraform.md)
