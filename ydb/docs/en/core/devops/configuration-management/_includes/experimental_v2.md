{% note warning %}

This article is dedicated to {{ ydb-short-name }} clusters that use [configuration V2](../../configuration-management/configuration-v2/index.md). This configuration method is currently experimental and is only available for {{ ydb-short-name }} versions starting from v25.1. For production use, we recommend choosing [configuration V1](../index.md) — it is the main method and is officially supported for all {{ ydb-short-name }} clusters.
