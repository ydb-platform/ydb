{% note warning %}

This article describes working with {{ ydb-short-name }} clusters using [configuration V1](../index.md). Configuration V1 was the main way to configure clusters managed by {{ ydb-short-name }} versions below v25.1. Starting from version v25.1, {{ ydb-short-name }} supports [configuration V2](../../configuration-v2/index.md), which is the recommended way to configure {{ ydb-short-name }} clusters with version v25.1 and above. For clusters using configuration V2, the instructions in this article are **not applicable**.

If your cluster has already been updated to version v25.1 or above but still uses configuration V1, it is recommended to plan [migration to configuration V2](../../migration/migration-to-v2.md), as support for configuration V1 will be discontinued in future versions of {{ ydb-short-name }}.
