# Cluster System Views

For internal introspection of cluster state, users can query special service views (system views). These views are available from the cluster root directory and use the system path prefix `.sys`.

Cloud database users typically do not have access to cluster system views, as the cloud team is responsible for their maintenance and timely diagnostics.

In the descriptions of available fields below, the **Key** column contains the primary key field index of the corresponding view.

{% note info %}

Similar system views exist for what happens inside a specific database, they are described in a [separate article for DBAs](../../dev/system-views.md).

## Distributed Storage

Information about distributed storage operation is contained in several interconnected views, each responsible for describing its own entity:

* PDisk
* VSlot
* Group
* Storage Pool

Additionally, there is a separate view that shows statistics on the usage of group numbers in different storage pools and the growth capabilities of these pools.

Accessing system views is more of an analytical workload. Frequent access to them in large databases will significantly consume system resources. The recommended load is no more than 1-2 RPS.
