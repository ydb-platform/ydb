# General questions about {{ ydb-short-name }}

#### What is {{ ydb-short-name }}? {#what-is-ydb}

{{ ydb-short-name }} is a distributed fault-tolerant SQL DBMS. {{ ydb-short-name }} offers high availability and scalability, while ensuring strong consistency and support for ACID transactions. Queries are made using an SQL dialect (YQL).

{{ ydb-short-name }} is a fully managed database. DB instances are created through the {{ ydb-short-name }} database management service.

#### What features does {{ ydb-short-name }} provide? {#ydb-features}

{{ ydb-short-name }} provides high availability and data security through synchronous replication in three availability zones. {{ ydb-short-name }} also ensures even load distribution across available hardware resources. This means you don't need to order resources, {{ ydb-short-name }}  automatically provisions and releases resources based on the user load.

#### What consistency model does {{ ydb-short-name }} use?  {#ydb-consistency}

To read data, {{ ydb-short-name }} uses a model of strict data consistency.

#### How do I design a primary key? {#create-pk}

To design a primary key properly, follow the rules below.

* Avoid situations where most of the load falls on a single [partition](../../concepts/datamodel/table.md#partitioning) of a table. With even load distribution, it's easier to achieve high overall performance.

  This rule implies that you shouldn't use a monotonically increasing sequence, such as timestamp, as a table's primary key.
* The fewer table partitions a query uses, the faster it runs. For greater performance, follow the one query â€” one partition rule.
* Avoid situations where a small part of the DB is under much heavier load than the rest of the DB.

For more information, see [choosing a primary key](../../dba/primary-key/index.md).

#### How do I evenly distribute load across table partitions? {#balance-shard-load}

You can use the following techniques to distribute the load evenly across table partitions and increase overall DB performance.

* To avoid using uniformly increasing primary key values, you can:
   * Change the order of its components.
   * use a hash of the key column values as the primary key.
* Reduce the number of partitions used in a single query.

For more information, see [choosing a primary key](../../dba/primary-key/index.md).

#### Can I use NULL in a key column? {#null}

In {{ ydb-short-name }}, all columns, including key ones, may contain a `NULL` value, but we don't recommend using `NULL` as values in key columns.

Per the SQL standard (ISO/IEC 9075), you can't compare `NULL` with other values. Therefore, the use of concise SQL statements with simple comparison operators may result in rows containing NULL being skipped during filtering, for example.

#### Is there an optimal size of a database row? {#string-size}

To achieve high performance, we don't recommend writing rows larger than 8 MB and key columns larger than 2 KB to the DB.

For more information about limits, see [Database limits](../../concepts/limits-ydb.md).

#### How are secondary indexes used in {{ ydb-short-name }}? {#secondary_indexes}

Secondary indexes in {{ ydb-short-name }} are global and can be non-unique.

For more information, see [Secondary indexes](../../concepts/secondary_indexes.md).

#### How are paginated results printed? {#paging}

To print paginated results, we recommend selecting data sorted by primary key sequentially, limiting the number of rows with the `LIMIT` keyword. We do not recommend using the `OFFSET` keyword to solve this problem.

For more information, see [Paginated results](../../dev/paging.md).

#### How do I delete expired data? {#ttl}

To efficiently delete outdated data, we recommend using [TTL](../../concepts/ttl.md).

#### Syncing two data centers in geographically distributed clusters {#sinc-between-dc}

The lead [tablet](../../concepts/cluster/common_scheme_ydb.md#tablets) writes data to a [distributed network storage](../../concepts/cluster/distributed_storage.md) that saves copies to several data centers. {{ ydb-short-name }} does not commit a user query until after the required number of copies are saved to the required number of data centers.
