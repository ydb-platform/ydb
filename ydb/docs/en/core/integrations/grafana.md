# {{ ydb-short-name }} data source for Grafana

The [{{ ydb-short-name }} data source plugin](https://grafana.com/grafana/plugins/ydbtech-ydb-datasource/) allows you to use [Grafana](https://grafana.com) to query and visualize data from {{ ydb-short-name }}.

## Installation

Prerequisites: the plugin requires `v9.2` and higher of Grafana.

Follow the Grafana's [plugin installation docs](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/plugins/installation/) to install a plugin named `ydb-grafana-datasource-plugin`.

## Configuration

### {{ ydb-short-name }} user for the data source

Set up an {{ ydb-short-name }} user account with **read-only** permissions [(more about permissions)](../cluster/access.md) and access to databases and tables you want to query. 

{% note warning %}

Please note that Grafana does not validate that queries are safe. Queries can contain any SQL statements including data modification instructions.

{% endnote %}

### Data transfer protocol support

The plugin supports [gRPC and gRPCS](https://grpc.io/) transport protocols. If self-signed certificates are used on your {{ ydb-short-name }} cluster, specify the [Certificate Authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority) certificate, through which they were released.

### Configuration via UI

Once the plugin is installed on your Grafana instance, follow [these instructions](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/datasources/add-a-data-source/) to add a new {{ ydb-short-name }} data source, and enter configuration options.

### Configuration with provisioning system

Alternatively, it is possible to configure data sources using configuration files with Grafanaâ€™s provisioning system. To read about how it works, including all the settings that you can set for this data source, refer to [Provisioning Grafana data sources](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/administration/provisioning/#data-sources) documentation.

### Authentication

The Grafana plugin supports various authentication [authentication methods](../reference/ydb-sdk/auth.md).

Below is an example config for authenticating a {{ ydb-short-name }} data source using username and password:

```yaml
apiVersion: 1
datasources:
  - name: YDB
    type: ydbtech-ydb-datasource
    jsonData:
      authKind: '<password>'
      endpoint: 'grpcs://<hostname>:2135'
      dbLocation: '<location_to_db>'
      user: '<username>'
    secureJsonData:
      password: '<userpassword>'
      certificate: |
        <overall content of *.pem file>
```

Here are fields that are supported in connection configuration:

| Name  | Description         |         Type          |
| :---- | :------------------ | :-------------------: |
| authKind | Authentication type |       `"Anonymous"`, `"ServiceAccountKey"`, `"AccessToken"`, `"UserPassword"`, `"MetaData"`        |
| endpoint | Database endpoint  | `string` |
| dbLocation | Database location  | `string` |
| user | User name  | `string` |
| serviceAccAuthAccessKey | Service account access key  | `string` (secured) |
| accessToken | OAuth access token  | `string` (secured) |
| password | User password  | `string` (secured) |
| certificate | If self-signed certificates are used on your {{ ydb-short-name }} cluster, specify the [Certificate Authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority) certificate, through which they were issued.  | `string` (secured) |

## Building queries

{{ ydb-short-name }} is queried with a SQL dialect named [YQL](../yql/reference/index.md).
Queries can contain macros which simplify syntax and allow for dynamic parts. There are two kinds of macros - [Grafana-level](#macros) and {{ ydb-short-name }}-level. The plugin will parse query text and, before sending it to {{ ydb-short-name }}, substitute variables and Grafana-level macros with particular values. After that {{ ydb-short-name }}-level macroses will be treated by {{ ydb-short-name }} server-side. 
The query editor allows to get data in different representations: time series, table or logs.

### Time series { #time-series }

Time series visualization options are selectable if the query returns at least one field with `Date`, `Datetime`, or `Timestamp` type (for now work with time supported only in UTC format) and at least one field with `Int64`, `Int32`, `Int16`, `Int8`, `Uint64`, `Uint32`, `Uint16`, `Uint8`, `Double` or `Float` type. Then you can select time series visualization options. Grafana interprets timestamp rows without an explicit time zone as UTC. Any other column is treated as a value column.

#### Multi-line time series

To create multi-line time series, the query must return at least 3 fields in the following order:

- field 1: `Date`, `Datetime` or `Timestamp`
- field 2: value to group by
- field 3+: the metric values

For example:

```sql
SELECT `timestamp`, `requestTime`, AVG(`responseStatus`) AS `avgRespStatus`
FROM `/database/endpoint/my-logs`
GROUP BY `requestTime`, `timestamp`
ORDER BY `timestamp`
```

### Tables { #tables }

Table visualizations will always be available for any valid {{ ydb-short-name }} query with exactly one result set.


![Table](../_assets/grafana/table.png)

### Visualizing logs with the Logs Panel { #visual-logs }

To use the Logs panel your query must return a `Date`, `Datetime` or `Timestamp` and `String` values. You can select logs visualizations using the visualization options.

By default, only the first text field will be represented as log line. This can be customized using the query builder.

### Macros

To simplify syntax and to allow for dynamic parts, like date range filters, the query can contain macros.

Here is an example of a query with a macro that will use Grafana's time filter:

```sql
SELECT `timeCol`
FROM `/database/endpoint/my-logs`
WHERE $__timeFilter(`timeCol`)
```

```sql
SELECT `timeCol`
FROM `/database/endpoint/my-logs`
WHERE $__timeFilter(`timeCol` + INTERVAL("PT24H"))
```

| Macro                                        | Description                                                                                                                      | Output example                                                                                  |
| -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `$__timeFilter(columnName)`                | Replaced by a conditional that filters the data (using the provided column or expression) based on the time range of the panel in microseconds | `foo >= CAST(1636717526371000 AS TIMESTAMP) AND foo <=  CAST(1668253526371000 AS TIMESTAMP)' )` |
| `$__fromTimestamp`                         | Replaced by the starting time of the range of the panel casted to Timestamp                                                      | `CAST(1636717526371000 AS TIMESTAMP)`                                                           |
| `$__toTimestamp`                           | Replaced by the ending time of the range of the panel casted to Timestamp                                                        | `CAST(1636717526371000 AS TIMESTAMP)`                                                           |
| `$__varFallback(condition, $templateVar)` | Replaced by the first parameter when the template variable in the second parameter is not provided.                              | `$__varFallback('foo', $bar)` `foo` if variable `bar` is not provided, or `$bar`'s value                                                               |

### Templates and variables

To add a new {{ ydb-short-name }} query variable, refer to [Add a query variable](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/variables/variable-types/add-query-variable/).
After creating a variable, you can use it in your {{ ydb-short-name }} queries by using [Variable syntax](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/variables/syntax/).
For more information about variables, refer to [Templates and variables](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/variables/).
