# Importing table structures and data from JDBC data sources to {{ ydb-short-name }}

## Introduction {#intro}

Table structures and data can be imported into YDB from data sources accessible via JDBC drivers using the [JDBC import tool](https://www.github.com/ydb-platform/ydb-importer/). This can be useful for migrating from other database management systems to {{ ydb-short-name }} or just importing your real data to run some benchmarks on {{ ydb-short-name }}.

Data import is performed using the following process:

1. The tool connects to the source database and determines the list of tables and custom SQL queries to be imported.
2. The structure of target YDB tables is generated and optionally saved as YQL script.
3. The target database is checked for the existence of the target tables. Missing tables are created, and already existing ones may be left as is or re-created.
4. Row data is imported by reading from the source database using the SELECT statements and written into the target YDB database using the Bulk Upsert mechanism.

All operations, including metadata extraction from the source database, table creation (and re-creation) in the target database, and row data import, are performed in parallel mode (thread-per-table), using multiple concurrent threads and multiple open connections to both source and target databases. The maximum degree of parallelism is configurable, although the number of concurrent operations can't exceed the number of imported tables or custom SQL queries.

## Import tool installation {#install}

To run the import tool, JDK 8 or later is required, with the `java` executable available in the program search path. The tool has been built and tested using OpenJDK 8.

Import tool binary distribution is available on the [Releases page](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb-importer/releases). The import tool is provided as the ZIP archive, which needs to be unpacked into the local directory on the server where the tool is required to run.

The import tool distribution archive contains the configuration file examples as `*.xml` files, sample tool startup script `ydb-importer.sh`, and the executable code for the tool and its dependencies (including the [YDB Java SDK](../../reference/ydb-sdk/index.md)) as `lib/*.jar` files.

Before running the import tool, the JDBC drivers for the source databases should be put (as `*.jar` files) into the `lib` subdirectory of the tool installation directory.

## Using the import tool {#use}

The tool reads the XML configuration file on startup. When running the tool, the file name must be specified as a free command line argument. Settings in the configuration file define:

* source database type and connection preferences;
* {{ ydb-short-name }} target database connection preferences;
* (optional) file name to save the generated YQL script with YDB target tables structure;
* the rules to filter source tables' names;
* the list of custom SQL queries to fetch data from the data source (can be used to define custom queries to get data from all or some of the tables);
* the rules to generate target tables' names based on the names of the source tables;
* the degree of parallelism (which determines the worker pool size, plus the connection pool sizes for both source and target databases).

The configuration file based on one of the provided samples needs to be prepared before running the import tool.

The example command to run the tool is provided in the [ydb-importer.sh](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb-importer/blob/main/scripts/ydb-importer.sh) file, which can also be used to run the tool as shown below:

```bash
./ydb-importer.sh my-import-config.xml
```

## Import tool limitations {#limitations}

The tested data sources include the following database management systems:

* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
* [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)
* [Oracle Database](https://www.oracle.com/database/)
* [Microsoft SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/sql-server/)
* [IBM Db2](https://www.ibm.com/products/db2)
* [IBM Informix](https://www.ibm.com/products/informix)

Other data sources will likely work, too, as the tool uses the generic JDBC APIs to retrieve data and metadata.

Secondary indexes are not imported.

Some data types and table structures are known to be unsupported:

* the embedded tables for Oracle Database
* spatial data type for Microsoft SQL Server
* object data types for Informix

### Handling tables without the primary key {#nopk}

Each {{ ydb-short-name }} table must have a primary key. If a primary key (or at least a unique index) is defined on the source table, the tool creates the primary key for the target  {{ ydb-short-name }} table with the columns and order determined by the original primary key. When multiple unique indexes are defined on the source table, the tool prefers the index with the smallest number of columns.

In case the source table has no primary key and no unique indexes, primary key columns can be configured using the import settings in the configuration file as a sequence of `key-column` elements in the `table-ref` section (see below the example in the description of the configuration file format).

When no primary key is defined anywhere, the tool automatically adds the column `ydb_synth_key` to the target table and uses it as the primary key. The values of the synthetic primary key are computed as "SHA-256" hash code over the values of all row cells except the columns of the `BLOB` type.

If the input table contains several rows with completely identical values, the destination table will have only one row per each set of duplicate input rows. This also means that the tool cannot import the table in which all columns are of `BLOB` type.

### Importing large objects (BLOB, XML) {#blob}

For each BLOB field in the source database, the import tool creates an additional {{ ydb-short-name }} target table (BLOB supplemental table) with the following schema:

```yql
CREATE TABLE `blob_table`(
    `id` Int64,
    `pos` Int32,
    `val` String,
    PRIMARY KEY(`id`, `pos`)
)
```

The name of the BLOB supplemental table is generated based on the `table-options` / `blob-name-format` setting in the configuration file.

Each BLOB field value is saved as a sequence of records in the BLOB supplemental table in {{ ydb-short-name }}. Actual data is stored in the `val` field, storing no more than 64K bytes. The order of blocks stored is defined by the values of the `pos` column, containing the integer values `1..N`.

For each source BLOB value, a unique value of type `Int64` is generated and stored in the `id` field of the BLOB supplemental table.
This identifier is also stored in the "main" target table in a field that has the same name as the BLOB field in the source table.

For PostgreSQL, working with the `EXTENSION lo` BLOBS may require extra permissions for the account used to connect to the data source. An alternative option is to enable the compatibility mode on the database level using the following statement:

```yql
ALTER DATABASE dbname SET lo_compat_privileges TO on;
```

## Configuration file format {#config}

Sample configuration files:

* [for PostgreSQL](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb-importer/blob/main/scripts/sample-postgres.xml)
* [for MySQL](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb-importer/blob/main/scripts/sample-mysql.xml)
* [for Oracle Database](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb-importer/blob/main/scripts/sample-oracle.xml)
* [for Microsoft SQL Server](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb-importer/blob/main/scripts/sample-mssql.xml)
* [for IBM Db2](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb-importer/blob/main/scripts/sample-db2.xml)
