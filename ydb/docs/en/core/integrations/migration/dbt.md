# {{ dbt-name }} Integration With YDB

## Introduction

[{{ dbt-name }}](https://www.getdbt.com) is a popular tool for data transformation and management that enables you to:

- Configure reliable and consistent transformation pipelines using `SELECT` statements that reflect business logic
- Implement version control and CI/CD practices for transformation code
- Test data and detect anomalies to ensure data quality
- Generate documentation and visualize dependencies between data

The [{{ dbt-ydb }}](https://github.com/ydb-platform/dbt-ydb) connector provides seamless integration between {{ dbt }} and [{{ ydb-short-name }}](../../concepts/glossary.md), enabling data transformation, modeling, and pipeline management directly within {{ ydb-short-name }}.

The {{ dbt-ydb }} connector is currently in development and has several significant limitations. These limitations will be removed in future versions.

## Features

### Models And Their Materialization

A core concept in {{ dbt }} is a [data model](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/sql-models). By its nature, it is a SQL expression that can use any data sources inside your data warehouse, including other models. There are different approaches to physically creating a model (its materialization). Each approach defines how exactly the query will be executed: by creating a new table, updating an existing one, or simply forming a view.

The {{ dbt-ydb }} connector supports the following materialization strategies:

- View — materialized as a database view in YDB
- Table — persisted as a table in YDB and recreated by {{ dbt }} on every run
- [Incremental model](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/incremental-models-overview) — created as a table in {{ ydb-short-name }}, but during updates, it is not recreated; instead, it is updated with changed and new rows. The connector currently supports the [`MERGE` strategy](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/incremental-strategy#merge).

Another materialization type, [ephemeral model](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/materializations#ephemeral), is currently not supported by the connector.

### Snapshots

The [snapshot mechanism](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/snapshots) is currently not supported by {{ dbt‑ydb }}.

### Seeds

The {{ dbt‑ydb }} connector supports {{ dbt }}’s ability to define [seeds](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/seeds) for loading reference and test data from CSV files into your project and using them in other models.

### Data Testing

The {{ dbt‑ydb }} connector supports standard [{{ dbt }} data tests](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/data-tests#generic-data-tests), as well as [specific tests](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/data-tests#singular-data-tests) within the capabilities of [YQL](../../yql/reference/index.md).

### Documentation Generation

dbt-ydb supports generating [documentation](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/documentation) from dbt projects for YDB.

## Getting Started

To get started with dbt on YDB, you will need:

- Python 3.10 or later.
- dbt Core (1.8 or later).
    Note: dbt Fusion (2.0) is currently not supported.
- An existing {{ ydb-short-name }} cluster; single-node installation from [Quick Start guide](../../quickstart.md) will be sufficient.

To install dbt-ydb, you can run the following command:

``` text
pip install dbt-ydb
```

## Running the Example Project

A ready-to-use [example project](https://github.com/ydb-platform/dbt-ydb/tree/main/examples/jaffle_shop) is included with the dbt-ydb connector to help you quickly test or explore dbt’s capabilities with YDB:

1. Clone the repository

``` text
git clone https://github.com/ydb-platform/dbt-ydb.git
cd dbt-ydb/examples/jaffle_shop
```

2. Configure the connection profile to your YDB in the `profiles.yml` file. Connection and authentication methods are described [here](https://github.com/ydb-platform/dbt-ydb?tab=readme-ov-file#profile-configuration). For a single-node installation from [Quick Start guide](../../quickstart.md), the file should look like this:

``` text
profile_name:
  target: dev
  outputs:
    dev:
      type: ydb
      host: localhost # YDB host
      port: 2136 # YDB port
      database: /local # YDB database
      schema: jaffle_shop
```

3. Test the connection

``` bash
dbt debug
```

4. Load test data (seeds)

``` bash
dbt seed
```

This command will load CSV files from the `data/` directory into `raw_*` tables in YDB.

5. Run models

``` bash
dbt run
```

This will create tables and views based on SQL models from the `models/` directory.

6. Test data in models

``` bash
dbt test
```

This will verify data quality according to defined rules.

7. Generate documentation

``` bash
dbt docs generate
dbt docs serve
```

Project documentation will be available in your browser at: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
