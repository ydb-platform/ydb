At the moment, {{ ydb-short-name }}'s compatibility with PostgreSQL **is under development**, so not all PostgreSQL constructs and [functions](../functions.md) are supported yet. PostgreSQL compatibility is available for testing in the form of a Docker container, which can be deployed by following these [instructions](../docker-connect.md).
