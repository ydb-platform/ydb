## Designing YDB: Constructing a Distributed cloud-native DBMS for OLTP and OLAP from the Ground Up {#2025-conf-fosdem}

{% include notitle [database_internals_tag](../_includes/tags.md#database_internals) %}

Distributed systems offer multiple advantages: they are built to be fault-tolerant and reliable, can scale almost infinitely, provide low latency in geo-distributed scenarios, and, finally, are geeky and fun to explore. YDB is an open-source distributed SQL database that has been running in production for years. Some installations include thousands of servers storing petabytes of data. To provide these capabilities, any distributed DBMS must achieve consistency and consensus while tolerating unreliable networks, faulty hardware, and the absence of a global clock.

In this session, we will provide a gentle introduction to the problems, challenges, and fallacies of distributed computing, explaining why sharded systems like Citus are not always ACID-compliant and how they differ from truly distributed systems. Then, we will dive deep into the design decisions made by YDB to address these difficulties and outline YDB's architecture layer by layer: from bare metal disks and distributed storage to OLTP and OLAP functionalities. Finally, we will briefly compare our approach with that of Calvin, which originally inspired YDB, and Spanner.

Distributed systems are great in multiple aspects: they are built to be fault-tolerant and reliable, can scale almost infinitely, provide low latency in geo-distributed scenarios, and, finally, they are geeky and fun to explore.

Then, we will dive deep into the design decisions made by YDB to address these difficulties and outline YDB's architecture layer by layer, from the bare metal disks and distributed storage up to OLTP and OLAP functionalities. Ultimately, we will briefly compare our approach with Calvin's, which initially inspired YDB, and Spanner.

## YDB: How to implement streaming RAG in a distributed database {#2025-conf-fossasia-zevaykin-kalinina}

{% include notitle [database_internals_tag](../_includes/tags.md#database_internals) %}

Extracting real-time insights from multi-modal data streams across diverse domains presents an ongoing challenge. A promising solution lies in the implementation of Streaming Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques. YDB enhances this approach by offering robust services for both vector search and streaming, facilitating more efficient and effective data processing and retrieval.
YDB is a versatile open-source Distributed SQL Database that combines high availability and scalability with strong consistency and ACID transactions.

## Sharded and Distributed Are Not the Same: What You Must Know When PostgreSQL Is Not Enough {#2025-conf-pgconf-India}

{% include notitle [testing_tag](../_includes/tags.md#testing) %}

It's no secret that PostgreSQL is extremely efficient and scales vertically well. At the same time, it isn't a secret that PostgreSQL scales only vertically, meaning its performance is limited by the capabilities of a single server. Most Citus-like solutions allow the database to be sharded, but a sharded database is not distributed and does not provide ACID guarantees for distributed transactions. The common opinion about distributed DBMSs is diametrically opposed: they are believed to scale well horizontally and have ACID distributed transactions but have lower efficiency in smaller installations.

When comparing monolithic and distributed DBMSs, discussions often focus on architecture but rarely provide specific performance metrics. This presentation, on the other hand, is entirely based on an empirical study of this issue. Our approach is simple: [{{ team.ivanov.name }}]({{ team.ivanov.profile }}) ({{ team.ivanov.position }}) installed PostgreSQL and distributed DBMSs on identical clusters of three physical servers and compared them using the popular TPC-C benchmark.
