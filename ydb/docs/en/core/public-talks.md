## 2023: Highload++ Serbia {#highload-serbia-2023}

* Subject: Scale it easy: YDB's high performance in a nutshell.

  * [About the event](https://highload.rs/2023/abstracts/9754).
  * [Presentation](https://presentations.ydb.tech/2023/en/highload_serbia/ydb_performance/presentation.pdf).
  * [Broadcast recording](https://youtu.be/iMjq96GQTHQ?si=moMbI3Je90s3zY60).
  * Description: Implementing a distributed database with strong consistency isn’t difficult; the challenge lies in ensuring speed and scalability. YDB excels in these aspects. In this talk, we’ll discuss YDB’s architecture and its high performance, present results of benchmarks, and compare YDB to top competitors.

## 2022: Webinar YDB 2022-08-15 {#webinar20220815}

* Subject: Scalability and Fault Tolerance in YDB.

  * [Broadcast recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYpyKXihGaY).
  * Description: In this talk we will cover two layers of YDB: Tablet and BlobStorage layers that together provide fault tolerance, scalability, and user isolation.

## 2022: Hydra {#hydra-2022}

* Subject: Parallel Asynchronous Replication between YDB Database Instances.

  * [About the event](https://hydraconf.com/talks/d63511d6011a4b458b9c16be675f6897/).
  * [Presentation](https://squidex.jugru.team/api/assets/srm/acbeabc7-56f1-4234-9e97-0e66c33be4ce/hydra-2022-fomichev-nizametdinov-1-.pdf).
  * [Broadcast recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga2Eg2rbPPc).
  * Description: In this talk we present an approach to asynchronous replication in YDB that provides the following characteristics: changefeed from source database is sharded among multiple persistent queues, sharded changefeed is applied to the target database in a manner to guarantee target database consistency.
