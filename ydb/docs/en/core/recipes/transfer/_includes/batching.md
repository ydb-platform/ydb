Rows are not added to the table for each message received from the topic; instead, they are buffered and inserted in batches. By default, data is written to the table every 60 seconds or when the volume of accumulated data reaches 8 MB. These parameters can be explicitly configured when [creating](../../../yql/reference/syntax/create-transfer.md) a transfer or [modified](../../../yql/reference/syntax/alter-transfer.md) later.
