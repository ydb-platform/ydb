# actor_system_config

The CPU resources are mainly used by the actor system. Depending on the type, all actors run in one of the pools (the `name` parameter). Configuring is allocating a node's CPU cores across the actor system pools. When allocating them, please keep in mind that PDisks and the gRPC API run outside the actor system and require separate resources.

You can set up your actor system either [automatically](#autoconfig) or [manually](#tuneconfig). In the `actor_system_config` section, specify:

* Node type and the number of CPU cores allocated to the ydbd process by automatic configuring.
* Number of CPU cores for each {{ ydb-full-name }} cluster subsystem in the case of manual configuring.

Automatic configuring adapts to the current system workload. It is recommended in most cases.

You might opt for manual configuring when a certain pool in your actor system is overwhelmed and undermines the overall database performance. You can track the workload on your pools on the [Embedded UI monitoring page](../../reference/embedded-ui/ydb-monitoring.md#node_list_page).

## Automatic configuring {#autoconfig}

Example of the `actor_system_config` section for automatic configuring of the actor system:

```yaml
actor_system_config:
  use_auto_config: true
  node_type: STORAGE
  cpu_count: 10
```

| `scheduler`                   | Scheduler configuration. The actor system scheduler is responsible for the delivery of deferred messages exchanged by actors.<br/>We do not recommend changing the default scheduler parameters.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `progress_threshold`          | The actor system supports requesting message sending scheduled for a later point in time. The system might fail to send all scheduled messages at some point. In this case, it starts sending them in "virtual time" by handling message sending in each loop over a period that doesn't exceed the `progress_threshold` value in microseconds and shifting the virtual time by the `progress_threshold` value until it reaches real time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `resolution`                  | When making a schedule for sending messages, discrete time slots are used. The slot duration is set by the `resolution` parameter in microseconds.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
