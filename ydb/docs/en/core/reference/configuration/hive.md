# hive_config

[Hive](../../concepts/glossary.md#hive) is a YDB component responsible for launching [tablets](../../concepts/glossary.md#tablet). In various situations and under different load patterns, you might need to configure its behavior. Hive behavior is configured in the `hive_config` section of the {{ ydb-short-name }} cluster configuration. Some configuration options are also available for editing through the [Hive web-viewer](../embedded-ui/hive.md#settings) interface. Settings configured through the interface take priority over those specified in the configuration. Below are all available options, with the corresponding option name in the interface indicated if the option can be edited through the interface.

## Tablet Boot Options {#boot}

These options allow you to control the speed at which [tablets are booted](../../contributor/hive-booting.md) and how [nodes are selected](../../contributor/hive-booting.md#findbestnode) for them.

#|
|| Configuration Parameter Name | Hive Web-viewer Parameter Name | Format | Description | Default Value ||
|| `max_tablets_scheduled` | MaxTabletsScheduled | Integer | Maximum number of tablets simultaneously in the startup process on a single node. | 100 ||
|| `max_boot_batch_size` | MaxBootBatchSize | Integer | Maximum number of tablets from the Hive [boot queue](../../contributor/hive-booting.md#bootqueue) processed at once. | 1000 ||
|| `node_select_strategy` | NodeSelectStrategy | Enumeration | Node selection strategy for tablet startup. Possible values:

- `HIVE_NODE_SELECT_STRATEGY_WEIGHTED_RANDOM` — weighted random selection based on consumption;
- `HIVE_NODE_SELECT_STRATEGY_EXACT_MIN` — select node with minimum consumption;
- `HIVE_NODE_SELECT_STRATEGY_RANDOM_MIN_7P` — select random node among 7% of nodes with lowest consumption;
- `HIVE_NODE_SELECT_STRATEGY_RANDOM` — select random node.

| `HIVE_NODE_SELECT_STRATEGY_RANDOM_MIN_7P` ||
|| `boot_strategy` | — | Enumeration | Controls behavior when starting large numbers of tablets. Possible values:

* `HIVE_BOOT_STRATEGY_BALANCED` — when the `max_tablets_scheduled` limit is reached on one node, stops starting new tablets on all nodes.
* `HIVE_BOOT_STRATEGY_FAST` — when the `max_tablets_scheduled` limit is reached on one node, continues starting tablets on other nodes.

If one node starts tablets slightly slower than others when starting a large number of tablets, then using `HIVE_BOOT_STRATEGY_FAST` will result in fewer tablets being started on that node than on the others. Using `HIVE_BOOT_STRATEGY_BALANCED` in the same situation will distribute tablets evenly across nodes, but their startup will take longer.

| `HIVE_BOOT_STRATEGY_BALANCED` ||
|| `default_tablet_limit` | — | Nested section | Limits on starting tablets of various types on a single node. Specified as a list format where each element has `type` and `max_count` fields. | Empty section ||
|| `default_tablet_preference` | — | Nested section | Priorities for selecting data centers for starting tablets of various types. For each tablet type, you can specify multiple data center groups. Data centers within the same group will have equal priority, with earlier groups having priority over subsequent ones. Example format:

```yaml
default_tablet_preference:
  - type: Coordinator
    data_centers_preference:
      - data_centers_group:
        - "dc-1"
        - "dc-2"
      - data_centers_group:
        - "dc-3"
```

| Empty section ||
|| `system_category_id` | — | Integer | When specifying any number other than 0, all coordinators and mediators are launched in the same data center whenever possible. | 1 ||
|# {wide-content}

### Example

{% note info %}

In the `default_tablet_limit` and `default_tablet_preference` subsections, you need to specify tablet types. Exact tablet type names are specified in the [glossary](../../concepts/glossary.md#tablet-types).

{% endnote %}

```yaml
hive_config:
  max_tablets_scheduled: 10
  node_select_strategy: HIVE_NODE_SELECT_STRATEGY_RANDOM
  boot_strategy: HIVE_BOOT_STRATEGY_FAST
  default_tablet_limit:
    - type: PersQueue
      max_count: 15
    - type: DataShard
      max_count: 100
  default_tablet_preference:
    - type: Coordinator
      data_centers_preference:

          - "dc-2"
        - data_centers_group:
          - "dc-3"
```

## Auto-Balancing Options {#autobalancing}

These options control the [auto-balancing](../../contributor/hive.md#autobalancing) process: in which situations it starts, how many tablets it moves at what intervals, how it selects nodes and tablets. Some options are presented in two variations: for "emergency balancing," i.e., balancing when one or more nodes are overloaded, and for all other types of balancing.

### Examples

With this configuration file, you can completely disable all types of tablet auto-balancing between nodes.

```yaml
hive_config:
  min_cpuscatter_to_balance: 1.0
  min_memory_scatter_to_balance: 1.0
  min_network_scatter_to_balance: 1.0
  min_counter_scatter_to_balance: 1.0
  max_node_usage_to_kick: 3.0
  object_imbalance_to_balance: 1.0
```

With this configuration file, you can disable all types of auto-balancing between nodes for tablets participating in transaction distribution, i.e., [coordinators](../../concepts/glossary.md#coordinator) and [mediators](../../concepts/glossary.md#mediator). Exact tablet type names are specified in the [glossary](../../concepts/glossary.md#tablet-types).

```yaml
hive_config:
  balancer_ignore_tablet_types:
    - Coordinator
    - Mediator
```

When using Hive UI for the same effect, you need to enter `Coordinator;Mediator` in the input field for the BalancerIgnoreTabletTypes setting.

## Restart Tracking Options {#restarts}

Hive tracks how often various nodes and tablets restart to identify problematic ones. Using these options, you can configure which tablets or nodes will be considered problematic and how this will affect them.
