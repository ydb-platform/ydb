# host_configs

A {{ ydb-short-name }} cluster consists of multiple nodes, and one or more typical server configurations are usually used for their deployment. To avoid repeating their description for each node, there is a `host_configs` section in the configuration file that lists the used configurations and assigned IDs.

## Syntax

```yaml
host_configs:
- host_config_id: 1
  drive:
  - path: <path_to_device>
    type: <type>
  - path: ...
- host_config_id: 2
  ...
```

The `host_config_id` attribute specifies a numeric configuration ID. The `drive` attribute contains a collection of descriptions of connected drives. Each description consists of two attributes:

- `path`: Path to the mounted block device, for example, `/dev/disk/by-partlabel/ydb_disk_ssd_01`
- `type`: Type of the device's physical media: `ssd`, `nvme`, or `rot` (rotational - HDD)

## Examples

One configuration with ID 1 and one SSD disk accessible via `/dev/disk/by-partlabel/ydb_disk_ssd_01`:

```yaml
host_configs:
- host_config_id: 1
  drive:
  - path: /dev/disk/by-partlabel/ydb_disk_ssd_01
    type: SSD
```

Two configurations with IDs 1 (two SSD disks) and 2 (three SSD disks):

```yaml
host_configs:
- host_config_id: 1
  drive:
  - path: /dev/disk/by-partlabel/ydb_disk_ssd_01
    type: SSD
  - path: /dev/disk/by-partlabel/ydb_disk_ssd_02
    type: SSD
- host_config_id: 2
  drive:
  - path: /dev/disk/by-partlabel/ydb_disk_ssd_01
    type: SSD
  - path: /dev/disk/by-partlabel/ydb_disk_ssd_02
    type: SSD
  - path: /dev/disk/by-partlabel/ydb_disk_ssd_03
    type: SSD
```

## Kubernetes Features {#host-configs-k8s}

The {{ ydb-short-name }} Kubernetes operator mounts NBS disks for Storage nodes at the path `/dev/kikimr_ssd_00`. To use them, the following `host_configs` configuration must be specified:

```yaml
host_configs:
- host_config_id: 1
  drive:
  - path: /dev/kikimr_ssd_00
    type: SSD
```

The example configuration files provided with the {{ ydb-short-name }} Kubernetes operator contain this section, and it does not need to be changed.
