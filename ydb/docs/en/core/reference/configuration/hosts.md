# hosts

This group lists the static cluster nodes on which the Storage processes run and specifies their main characteristics:

- Numeric node ID
- DNS host name and port that can be used to connect to a node on the IP network
- ID of the [standard host configuration](host_configs.md)
- Placement in a specific availability zone, rack
- Server inventory number (optional)

## Syntax

```yaml
hosts:
- host: <DNS host name>
  host_config_id: <numeric ID of the standard host configuration>
  port: <port> # 19001 by default
  location:
    unit: <string with the server serial number>
    data_center: <string with the availability zone ID>
    rack: <string with the rack ID>
- host: <DNS host name>
  ...
```

## Examples

```yaml
hosts:
- host: hostname1
  host_config_id: 1
  node_id: 1
  port: 19001
  location:
    unit: '1'
    data_center: '1'
    rack: '1'
- host: hostname2
  host_config_id: 1
  node_id: 2
  port: 19001
  location:
    unit: '1'
    data_center: '1'
    rack: '1'
```

## Kubernetes-Specific Details {#hosts-k8s}

When deploying {{ ydb-short-name }} with a Kubernetes operator, the entire `hosts` section is generated automatically, replacing any user-specified content in the configuration passed to the operator. All Storage nodes use `host_config_id` = `1`, for which the [correct configuration](host_configs.md#host-configs-k8s) must be specified.
