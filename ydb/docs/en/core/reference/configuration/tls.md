# TLS configuration

{{ ydb-short-name }} supports [data-in-transit encryption](../../security/encryption/data-in-transit.md), and each network protocol can have different [TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) settings. This documentation section provides a reference for configuring TLS in {{ ydb-short-name }}.

## Interconnect

The [{{ ydb-short-name }} actor system interconnect](../../concepts/glossary.md#actor-system-interconnect) is a specialized protocol for communication between {{ ydb-short-name }} nodes.

Example of enabling TLS for the interconnect:

```yaml
interconnect_config:
   start_tcp: true
   encryption_mode: REQUIRED # or OPTIONAL
   path_to_certificate_file: "/opt/ydb/certs/node.crt"
   path_to_private_key_file: "/opt/ydb/certs/node.key"
   path_to_ca_file: "/opt/ydb/certs/ca.crt"
```

## {{ ydb-short-name }} as a server

### gRPC

The main [{{ ydb-short-name }} API](../../reference/ydb-sdk/overview-grpc-api.md) is based on [gRPC](https://grpc.io/). It is used for external communication with client applications that work natively with {{ ydb-short-name }} via the [SDK](../../reference/ydb-sdk/index.md) or [CLI](../../reference/ydb-cli/index.md).

Example of enabling TLS for gRPC API:

```yaml
grpc_config:
   cert: "/opt/ydb/certs/node.crt"
   key: "/opt/ydb/certs/node.key"
   ca: "/opt/ydb/certs/ca.crt"
```

### PostgreSQL wire protocol

{{ ydb-short-name }} exposes a separate network port for the [PostgreSQL wire protocol](../../postgresql/intro.md). This protocol is used for external communication with client applications initially designed to work with [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/).

Example of enabling TLS for the PostgreSQL wire protocol:

```yaml
local_pg_wire_config:
    ssl_certificate: "/opt/ydb/certs/node.crt"
```

### Kafka wire protocol

{{ ydb-short-name }} exposes a separate network port for the [Kafka wire protocol](../../reference/kafka-api/index.md). This protocol is used for external communication with client applications initially designed to work with [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/).

Example of enabling TLS for the Kafka wire protocol with a file containing both the certificate and the private key:

```yaml
kafka_proxy_config:
    ssl_certificate: "/opt/ydb/certs/node.crt"
```

Example of enabling TLS for the Kafka wire protocol with the certificate and private key in separate files:

```yaml
kafka_proxy_config:
    cert: "/opt/ydb/certs/node.crt"
    key: "/opt/ydb/certs/node.key"
```

### HTTP

{{ ydb-short-name }} exposes a separate HTTP network port for running the [Embedded UI](../../reference/embedded-ui/index.md), exposing [metrics](../../devops/manual/monitoring.md), and other miscellaneous endpoints.

Example of enabling TLS on the HTTP port, making it HTTPS:

```yaml
monitoring_config:
    monitoring_certificate_file: "/opt/ydb/certs/node.crt"
```

## {{ ydb-short-name }} as a client

### LDAP

{{ ydb-short-name }} supports [LDAP](../../concepts/auth.md#ldap) for user authentication. The LDAP protocol has two options for enabling TLS.

Example of enabling TLS for LDAP via the `StartTls` protocol extension:

```yaml
auth_config:
  ldap_authentication:
    use_tls:
      enable: true
      ca_cert_file: "/path/to/ca.pem"
      cert_require: DEMAND
  scheme: "ldap"
```

Example of enabling TLS for LDAP via `ldaps`:

```yaml
auth_config:
  ldap_authentication:
    use_tls:
      enable: false
      ca_cert_file: "/path/to/ca.pem"
      cert_require: DEMAND
  scheme: "ldaps"
```

### Federated queries

[Federated queries](../../concepts/federated_query/index.md) allow {{ ydb-short-name }} to query various external data sources. Whether these queries occur over TLS-encrypted connections is controlled by the `USE_TLS` setting of `CREATE EXTERNAL DATA SOURCE` queries. No changes to the server-side configuration are required.

### Tracing

{{ ydb-short-name }} can send [tracing](../../reference/observability/tracing/setup.md) data to an external collector via gRPC.

Example of enabling TLS for tracing data by specifying `grpcs://` protocol:

```yaml
tracing_config:
  backend:
    opentelemetry:
      collector_url: grpcs://example.com:4317
      service_name: ydb
```

## Asynchronous replication

[Asynchronous replication](../../concepts/async-replication.md) synchronizes data between two {{ ydb-short-name }} databases, where one serves as a client to the other. Whether this communication uses TLS-encrypted connections is controlled by the `CONNECTION_STRING` setting of [CREATE ASYNC REPLICATION](../../yql/reference/syntax/create-async-replication.md) queries. Use the `grpcs://` protocol for TLS connections. No changes to the server-side configuration are required.
