# Prerequisites for working with {{ ydb-short-name }} in Docker

Before using the {{ ydb-short-name }} in Docker, install and configure the Docker environment. Refer to the official documentation for your operating system:

- [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/)
- [macOS](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/)
- [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/)

Alternative installation methods, such as [colima](https://github.com/abiosoft/colima), are also supported.

The installation of {{ ydb-short-name }} by downloading the container image happens during the [first launch](start.md).
