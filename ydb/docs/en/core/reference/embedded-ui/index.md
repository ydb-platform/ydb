# Using the embedded web UI

{{ ydb-short-name }} provides tools for monitoring and determining system health:

* [{{ ydb-short-name }} Monitoring](ydb-monitoring.md): The main monitor of the cluster. It shows the health of nodes and storage groups.
* [Interconnect overview](interconnect-overview.md): The state of cluster interconnects.
* [Logs](logs.md): Each {{ ydb-short-name }} component writes messages to logs of different levels. They can be used to detect severe issues or identify the root causes of issues.
* [Charts](charts.md): {{ ydb-short-name }} collects a range of metrics that can be used to determine the health of the entire system or of a specific component.
