# Kafka API usage examples
<!-- markdownlint-disable blanks-around-fences -->

This example shows a code snippet for reading data from a topic via Kafka API without a consumer group (Manual Partition Assignment).
You don't need to create a consumer for this reading mode.

Before proceeding with the examples:

1. [Create a topic](../ydb-cli/topic-create.md).
1. [Add a consumer](../ydb-cli/topic-consumer-add.md).
1. If authentication is enabled, [create a user](../../security/authorization.md#user).

## How to try the Kafka API {#how-to-try-kafka-api}

### In Docker {#how-to-try-kafka-api-in-docker}

Run Docker following [the quickstart guide](../../quickstart.md#install), and the Kafka API will be available on port 9092.

## Kafka API usage examples

### Reading

Consider the following limitations of using the Kafka API for reading:

- No support for the [check.crcs](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#consumerconfigs_check.crcs) option.
- Only one partition assignment strategy - `roundrobin`.
- No reading without a pre-created consumer group.

Therefore, in the consumer configuration, you must always specify the **consumer group name** and the parameters:

- `check.crc=false`
- `partition.assignment.strategy=org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.RoundRobinAssignor`

Below are examples of reading using the Kafka protocol for various applications, programming languages, and frameworks without authentication.
For examples of how to set up authentication, see [Authentication examples](#authentication-examples).

#### Frequent problems and solutions

##### Unexpected error in join group response

Full text of an exception:

```txt
Unexpected error in join group response: This most likely occurs because of a request being malformed by the client library or the message was sent to an incompatible broker. See the broker logs for more details.
```

Most likely it means that a consumer group is not specified or, if specified, it does not exist in the YDB cluster.


Solution: create a consumer group in {{ ydb-short-name }} using [CLI](../ydb-cli/topic-consumer-add.md) or [SDK](../ydb-sdk/topic.md#alter-topic).



### Writing

{% note info %}

Using Kafka transactions when writing via Kafka API is currently not supported. Transactions are only available when using the [YDB Topic API](../ydb-sdk/topic.md#write-tx).

Otherwise, writing to Apache Kafka and {{ ydb-short-name }} Topics through Kafka API is no different.

### Authentication examples {#authentication-examples}

For more details on authentication, see the [Authentication](./auth.md) section. Below are examples of authentication in a cloud database and a local database.


{% note info %}

Currently, the only available authentication mechanism with Kafka API in {{ ydb-short-name }} Topics is `SASL_PLAIN`.

#### Authentication examples in on-prem YDB

To use authentication in a multinode self-deployed database:

1. Create a user. [How to do this in YQL](../../yql/reference/syntax/create-user.md). [How to execute YQL from CLI](../ydb-cli/yql.md).
2. Connect to the Kafka API as shown in the examples below. In all examples, it is assumed that:

   - YDB is running locally with the environment variable `YDB_KAFKA_PROXY_PORT=9092`, meaning that the Kafka API is available at `localhost:9092`. For example, you can run YDB in Docker as described [here](../../quickstart.md#install).

   - <username> is the username you specified when creating the user.
   - <password> is the user's password you specified when creating the user.

Examples are shown for reading, but the same configuration parameters work for writing to a topic as well.
