# Providing an external Trace-ID to {{ ydb-short-name }}

## gRPC API

{{ ydb-short-name }} supports the transmission of external trace identifiers for constructing a complete trace that might include multiple queries. The transmission of `trace-id` is carried out according to the [tracecontext specification](https://w3c.github.io/trace-context/#traceparent-header) — through the `traceparent` header of the [gRPC](https://grpc.io) request, a string of the form `00-0af7651916cd43dd8448eb211c80319c-b7ad6b7169203331-01` should be transmitted. It consists of 4 parts, separated by the `-` symbol:

1. **Version** – at the time of writing, the specification defines only version 00.
1. **Trace ID** – the identifier of the trace to which the request belongs.
1. **Parent ID** – the identifier of the parent span.
1. **Flags** – a set of recommendations for working with the data transmitted in the header.

Only version 00 is supported by {{ ydb-short-name }}, and the flags are ignored. If the header does not comply with the specification, it is ignored. All traces obtained in this way have a [verbosity level](./setup.md#tracing-levels) of 13 (all components are traced with the `Detailed` verbosity level).

{% note warning %}

In the presence of the [`external_throttling`](./setup.md#external-throttling) section and a flow of requests exceeding the set limits, not all requests may be traced. In the absence of the [`external_throttling`](./setup.md#external-throttling) section, the `traceparent` header is **ignored** and no external traces are continued.

## SDK Support

Some {{ ydb-short-name }} SDKs support the transmission of `trace-id`; you can find a list of these SDKs, as well as usage examples, on the page [{#T}](../../../reference/ydb-sdk/recipes/debug-jaeger.md).
