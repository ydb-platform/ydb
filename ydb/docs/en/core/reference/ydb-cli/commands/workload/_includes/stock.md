# Stock load

Simulates a warehouse of an online store: creates multi-product orders, gets a list of orders per customer.

## Types of load {#workload_types}

This load test runs 5 types of load:

* [user-hist](#get-customer-history): Reads the specified number of orders madeÂ by the customer with id = 10000. This creates a workload to read the same rows from different threads.
* [rand-user-hist](#get-random-customer-history): Reads the specified number of orders made by a randomly selected customer. A load that reads data from different threads is created.
* [add-rand-order](#insert-random-order): Generates an order at random. For example, a customer has created an order of 2 products, but hasn't yet paid for it, hence the quantities in stock aren't decreased for the products. The database writes the data about the order and products. The read/write load is created (the INSERT checks for an existing entry before inserting the data).
* [put-rand-order](#submit-random-order): Generates an order at random and processes it. For example, a customer has created and paid an order of 2 products. The data about the order and products is written to the database, product availability is checked and quantities in stock are decreased. A mixed data load is created.
* [put-same-order](#submit-same-order): Creates orders with the same set of products. For example, all customers buy the same set of products (a newly released phone and a charger). This creates a workload of competing updates of the same rows in the table.

## Load test initialization {#init}

To get started, create tables and populate them with data:
```bash
{{ ydb-cli }} workload stock init [init options...]
```

* `init options`: [Initialization options](#init_options).

See the description of the command to init the data load:

```bash
{{ ydb-cli }} workload init --help
```

### Available parameters {#init_options}

| Parameter name | Short name | Parameter description |
---|---|---
| `--products <value>` | `-p <value>` | Number of products. Valid values: between 1 and 500000. Default: 100. |
| `--quantity <value>` | `-q <value>` | Quantity of each product in stock. Default: 1000. |
| `--orders <value>` | `-o <value>` | Initial number of orders in the database. Default: 100. |
| `--min-partitions <value>` | - | Minimum number of shards for tables. Default: 40. |
| `--auto-partition <value>` | - | Enabling/disabling auto-sharding. Possible values: 0 or 1. Default: 1. |

3 tables are created using the following DDL statements:
```sql
CREATE TABLE `stock`(product Utf8, quantity Int64, PRIMARY KEY(product)) WITH (AUTO_PARTITIONING_BY_LOAD = ENABLED, AUTO_PARTITIONING_MIN_PARTITIONS_COUNT = <min-partitions>);
CREATE TABLE `orders`(id Uint64, customer Utf8, created Datetime, processed Datetime, PRIMARY KEY(id), INDEX ix_cust GLOBAL ON (customer, created)) WITH (READ_REPLICAS_SETTINGS = "per_az:1", AUTO_PARTITIONING_BY_LOAD = ENABLED, AUTO_PARTITIONING_MIN_PARTITIONS_COUNT = <min-partitions>, UNIFORM_PARTITIONS = <min-partitions>, AUTO_PARTITIONING_MAX_PARTITIONS_COUNT = 1000);
CREATE TABLE `orderLines`(id_order Uint64, product Utf8, quantity Int64, PRIMARY KEY(id_order, product)) WITH (AUTO_PARTITIONING_BY_LOAD = ENABLED, AUTO_PARTITIONING_MIN_PARTITIONS_COUNT = <min-partitions>, UNIFORM_PARTITIONS = <min-partitions>, AUTO_PARTITIONING_MAX_PARTITIONS_COUNT = 1000);
```

### Examples of load initialization {#init-stock-examples}

Creating a database with 1000 products, 10000 items of each product, and no orders:

```bash
{{ ydb-cli }} workload stock init -p 1000 -q 10000 -o 0
```

Creating a database with 10 products, 100 items of each product, 10 orders, and a minimum number of shards equal 100:
```bash
{{ ydb-cli }} workload stock init -p 10 -q 100 -o 10 --min-partitions 100
```

## Running a load test {#run}

To run the load, execute the command:
```bash
{{ ydb-cli }} workload stock run [workload type...] [global workload options...] [specific workload options...]
```
During this test, workload statistics for each time window are displayed on the screen.

* `workload type`: The [types of workload](#workload_types).
* `global workload options`: The [global options for all types of load](#global_workload_options).
* `specific workload options`: Options of a specific load type.

See the description of the command to run the data load:

```bash
{{ ydb-cli }} workload run --help
```

The number of products in the order is generated randomly based on an exponential distribution. Order processing consists in decreasing the number of ordered products in stock.

YQL query:
```sql
DECLARE $ido AS UInt64;
DECLARE $cust AS Utf8;
DECLARE $lines AS List<Struct<product:Utf8,quantity:Int64>>;
DECLARE $time AS DateTime;

INSERT INTO `orders`(id, customer, created) VALUES
    ($ido, $cust, $time);

UPSERT INTO `orderLines`(id_order, product, quantity)
    SELECT $ido, product, quantity FROM AS_TABLE( $lines );

$prods = SELECT * FROM orderLines AS p WHERE p.id_order = $ido;

$cnt = SELECT COUNT(*) FROM $prods;

$newq =
    SELECT
        p.product AS product,
        COALESCE(s.quantity, 0) - p.quantity AS quantity
    FROM $prods AS p
    LEFT JOIN stock AS s
    ON s.product = p.product;

$check = SELECT COUNT(*) AS cntd FROM $newq as q WHERE q.quantity >= 0;

UPSERT INTO stock
    SELECT product, quantity FROM $newq WHERE $check=$cnt;

$upo = SELECT id, $time AS tm FROM orders WHERE id = $ido AND $check = $cnt;

```sql
DECLARE $ido AS UInt64;
DECLARE $cust AS Utf8;
DECLARE $lines AS List<Struct<product:Utf8,quantity:Int64>>;
