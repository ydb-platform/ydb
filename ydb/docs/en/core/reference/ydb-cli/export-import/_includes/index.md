# Exporting and importing data

The YDB CLI contains a set of commands designed to export and import data and descriptions of data schema objects. Data can be exported to create backups for subsequent recovery and for other purposes.

- [The export file structure](../file-structure.md) is used for exporting data both to the file system and S3-compatible object storage.

- [Exporting data to the file system using `tools dump`](../tools-dump.md)

- [Importing data from the file system using `tools restore`](../tools-restore.md)

- [Connecting to and authenticating with S3-compatible object storage](../auth-s3.md)

- [Exporting data to S3-compatible object storage using `export s3`](../export-s3.md)

- [Importing data from S3-compatible object storage using `import s3`](../import-s3.md)
