# Backup collections overview

This section explains how to use backup collections for full and incremental backups, and how they interact with export/import tools.

**Important considerations:**

- Storage backends: cluster (current); export to FS/S3 via CLI tools
- Keep backup chains valid; apply retention with care
- Verify backups periodically and before critical restores

## What a collection contains

- A chain of backups (one full, zero or more incrementals)
- Metadata (e.g., metadata.json), schema mapping (mapping.json)
- Integrity info (checksums, possibly signatures)

## Supported backends

- **Cluster storage** (SQL: STORAGE='cluster') â€” Current implementation  
- **Export/import to filesystem or S3** using CLI tools (see [Restore operations](restore-from-collection.md))

## Security and integrity

- Verify backups before restore in critical workflows

## Limitations

- Respect chain order. Do not delete full backups that have dependent incrementals.
- Retention policies must preserve chain validity.
- Maximum chain length recommendations (see [Managing collections](manage-collections.md))
