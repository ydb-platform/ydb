# Vector Workload

This workload type is suited for testing the performance and completeness of exact and approximate [vector search](../../concepts/vector_search.md).

Testing of global and filtered [vector indexes](../../yql/reference/syntax/create_table/vector_index.md) is supported.

The test runs vector search queries and evaluates their performance and completeness. You can choose different indices and search parameters to understand their effect on the test results.

## Initializing the Test Environment

The test uses one or two pre-created tables with a vector column: main table and query table. They must contain train and test data sets, correspondingly.

If the query table isn't specified, the test set is generated using random selection from the main table.

A pre-created vector index is also required. Its name is passed in the options of the test.

You can see vector index creation examples on the documentation page [Vector Indexes](../../dev/vector-indexes.md#types).

## Test Algorithm

1. A test set is generated:
   - If a table with a test set is specified in the command line, the first `targets` entries in primary key order are selected from it.
   - Otherwise, `targets` random entries are selected from the main table.
2. Completeness measurement is performed:
   - Two queries are executed for each item in the test set.
   - The first query performs an [exact vector search](../../concepts/vector_search.md#vector-search-exact) (full scan) based on vector distance, forming the `R_exact` result set.
   - The second query performs an [approximate vector search](../../concepts/vector_search.md#vector-search-index) using the vector index, forming the `R_approx` result set.
   - If a filtered vector index is selected, both queries scan only the entries with matching vector column values.
   - Completeness of the approximate search is calculated using the formula $\frac{|R_{approx} \bigcap R_{exact}|}{R_{exact}}$ (here `|A|` is the number of elements in the set A and `A âˆ© B` is the intersection of sets A and B).
3. Performance measurement is performed:
   - Indexed search queries are run for a specified duration and with a specified number of parallel threads.
   - Each query is executed for a random entry from the test set.
   - The time limit and parallelism are specified in the [global options](commands/workload/index.md#global_workload_options).
   - The average number of requests per second (RPS) and response time percentiles are calculated.

## Running the test {#run-select}

Command syntax:

```bash
{{ ydb-cli }} [global options...] workload vector run select [global workload options...] [options...]
```

* `global workload options`: [Global options for all types of load](commands/workload/index.md#global_workload_options).
* `global options`: [Global parameters](commands/global-options.md).
* `options`: Command parameters.

### Example

```bash
{{ ydb-cli }} -e grpc://hostname:2135 -d /Root/testdb workload vector run select --table wikipedia --index idx_vector --limit 20 \
    --query-table wikipedia_sample --limit 20 --targets 100 --kmeans-tree-clusters 10 --recall
```

### Options

```bash
{{ ydb-cli }} workload vector run select --help
```

Command parameters:

Parameter name | Parameter description | Default value
---|---|---
`--table`                  | Main table name.                                  | `vector_index_workload`
`--index`                  | Index name.                                       | `index`
`--query-table`            | Name of the table with predefined search vectors. | empty
`--targets`                | Number of vectors to search as targets.           | `100`
`--limit`                  | Maximum number of vectors to return.              | `5`
`--kmeans-tree-clusters`   | Maximum number of clusters to use during search ([KMeansTreeSearchTopSize](../../yql/reference/syntax/select/vector_index.md#kmeanstreesearchtopsize)). | `1`
`--recall`                 | Measure [recall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_and_recall) metrics.                           | no
`--recall-threads`         | Number of concurrent queries during recall measurement. | `10`
`--non-indexed`            | Take vector settings from the index, but search without the index. | no

{% note warning %}

Pay attention to the `--kmeans-tree-clusters` parameter as raising it significantly increases completeness of the search at the expense of slowing it down. You can try values from 1 to the number of clusters specified when creating the index.

### Remarks

- The workload generates SQL queries selecting up to `limit` nearest rows according to vector distance from table `table` with index `index`.
- You don't need to specify column names (embedding, filter, primary key columns) or the distance function because they are determined automatically from the index definition.
- `targets` vectors are used as a test set. The workload either selects random rows from `table` or the first rows from `query-table` in primary key order.
- Random selection of test vectors from `table` works only if its primary key is numeric.
- If `query-table` is set, it must have the same vector and filter column names as in `table`.
- Search completeness measurement (`recall`) is performed as a separate stage before the primary performance test and shows the average rate of coincidence (from 0 to 1) of indexed search results with full-scan search results for all selected test vectors.

### Preparing a Test Sample from a Large Table

{% note warning %}

This step is only required if you don't already have a test dataset and if the primary key of the main table isn't numeric, because auto-generation of the test set doesn't work for non-numeric keys.

{% endnote %}

In this case, you may prepare a test set by selecting random rows from the main table manually. Example query to create the table for test samples:

```yql
CREATE TABLE vector_index_sample (
    id Uint64 NOT NULL,
    filter Uint64 NOT NULL,
    embedding String NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (id)
);
```

A query to fill it with approximately 1000 rows from a large table:

```yql
INSERT INTO vector_index_sample
SELECT id, filter, embedding FROM large_table
WHERE RandomNumber(id) < 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF / <number_of_rows_in_table> * 1000;
```

{% note tip %}

You can find the approximate number of rows in the table in [table statistics](commands/scheme-describe.md) without running `SELECT COUNT(*)`.
