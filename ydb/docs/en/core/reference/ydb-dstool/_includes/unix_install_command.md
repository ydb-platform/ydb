```bash
curl -sSL 'https://install.ydb.tech/dstool' | bash
```

The script will install the {{ ydb-short-name }} DSTool. If the script is run from a `bash` or `zsh` shell, it will also add the `ydb-dstool` executable to the `PATH` environment variable. Otherwise, you can run it from the `~/ydb/bin` folder or add it to `PATH` manually.
