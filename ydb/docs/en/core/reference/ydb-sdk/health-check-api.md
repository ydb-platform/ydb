# Health Check API

{{ ydb-short-name }} has a built-in self-diagnostic system, which can be used to get a brief report on the database status and information about existing issues.

To initiate the check, call the `SelfCheck` method from `NYdb::NMonitoring` namespace in the SDK. You must also pass the name of the checked DB as usual.

{% list tabs %}

- C++

  App code snippet for creating a client:

  ```cpp
  auto client = NYdb::NMonitoring::TMonitoringClient(driver);
  ```

  Calling `SelfCheck` method:

  ```cpp
  auto settings = TSelfCheckSettings();
  settings.ReturnVerboseStatus(true);
  auto result = client.SelfCheck(settings).GetValueSync();
  ```

{% endlist %}

## Call parameters {#call-parameters}

`SelfCheck` method provides information in the form of a [set of issues](#example-emergency) which could look like this:

```json
{
  "id": "RED-27c3-70fb",
  "status": "RED",
  "message": "Database has multiple issues",
  "location": {
    "database": {
      "name": "/slice"
    }
  },
  "reason": [
    "RED-27c3-4e47",
    "RED-27c3-53b5",
    "YELLOW-27c3-5321"
  ],
  "type": "DATABASE",
  "level": 1
}
```

This is a short messages each about a single issue. All parameters will affect the amount of information the service returns for the specified database.

The complete list of extra parameters is presented below:

{% list tabs %}

- C++

  ```c++
  struct TSelfCheckSettings : public TOperationRequestSettings<TSelfCheckSettings>{
      FLUENT_SETTING_OPTIONAL(bool, ReturnVerboseStatus);
      FLUENT_SETTING_OPTIONAL(EStatusFlag, MinimumStatus);
      FLUENT_SETTING_OPTIONAL(ui32, MaximumLevel);
  };
  ```

{% endlist %}

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|:----|:----|:----|
| `ReturnVerboseStatus` | `bool`         | If `ReturnVerboseStatus` is specified, the response will also include a summary of the overall health of the database in the `database_status` field ([Example](#example-verbose)). Default is false. |
| `MinimumStatus`       | [EStatusFlag] (#issue-status) | Each issue has a `status` field. If `minimum_status` is specified, issues with a higher `status` will be discarded. By default, all issues will be listed. |
| `MaximumLevel`        | `int32`        | Each issue has a `level` field. If `maximum_level` is specified, issues with deeper levels will be discarded. By default, all issues will be listed. |

## Response structure {#response-structure}

For the full response structure, see the [ydb_monitoring.proto](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb/public/api/protos/ydb_monitoring.proto) file in the {{ ydb-short-name }} Git repository.
Calling the `SelfCheck` method will return the following message:

```protobuf
message SelfCheckResult {
    SelfCheck.Result self_check_result = 1;
    repeated IssueLog issue_log = 2;
    repeated DatabaseStatus database_status = 3;
    LocationNode location = 4;
}
```

The shortest `HealthCheck` response looks like [this](#examples) . It is returned if there is nothing wrong with the database.

If any issues are detected, the `issue_log` field will contain descriptions of the issues with the following structure:

```protobuf
message IssueLog {
    string id = 1;
    StatusFlag.Status status = 2;
    string message = 3;
    Location location = 4;
    repeated string reason = 5;
    string type = 6;
    uint32 level = 7;
}
```


### Description of fields in the response {#fields-description}

| Field | Description |
|:----|:----|
| `self_check_result` | enum field which contains the [database check result](#selfcheck-result) |
| `issue_log.id` | A unique issue ID within this response. |
| `issue_log.status` |  enum field which contains the [issue status](#issue-status) |
| `issue_log.message` | Text that describes the issue. |
| `issue_log.location` | Location of the issue. This can be a physical location or an execution context. |
| `issue_log.reason` | This is a set of elements, each of which describes an issue in the system at a certain level. |
| `issue_log.type` | Issue category (by subsystem). Each type is at a certain level and interconnected with others through a [rigid hierarchy](#issues-hierarchy) (as shown in the picture above). |
| `issue_log.level` | Issue [nesting depth](#issues-hierarchy). |
| `database_status` | If the settings include `ReturnVerboseStatus` parameter, the `database_status` field will be populated. <br/>This field offers a comprehensive summary of the overall health of the database. <br/>It is designed to provide a quick overview of the database's condition, helping to assess its health and identify any major issuehs at a high level. [Example](#example-verbose). For the full response structure, see the [ydb_monitoring.proto](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb/public/api/protos/ydb_monitoring.proto) file in the {{ ydb-short-name }} Git repository. |
| `location` | Contains information about the host, where the `HealthCheck` service was called |

### Issues hierarchy {#issues-hierarchy}

Issues can be arranged hierarchically using the `id` and `reason` fields, which help visualize how issues in different modules affect the overall system state. All issues are arranged in a hierarchy where higher levels can depend on nested levels:

![cards_hierarchy](./_assets/hc_cards_hierarchy.png)

Each issue has a nesting `level`. The higher the `level`, the deeper the issue is within the hierarchy. Issues with the same `type` always have the same `level`, and they can be represented hierarchically.

![issues_hierarchy](./_assets/hc_types_hierarchy.png)

#### Database check result {#selfcheck-result}

The most general status of the database. It can have the following values:

| Value | Description |
|:----|:----|
| `GOOD` | No issues were detected. |
| `DEGRADED` | Degradation of at least one of the database systems was detected, but the database is still functioning (for example, allowable disk loss). |
| `MAINTENANCE_REQUIRED` | Significant degradation was detected, there is a risk of database unavailability, and human intervention is required. |
| `EMERGENCY` | A serious problem was detected in the database, with complete or partial unavailability. |

#### Issue status {#issue-status}

The status (severity) of the current issue:

| Value | Description |
|:----|:----|
| `GREY` | Unable to determine the status (an issue with the self-diagnostic subsystem). |
| `GREEN` | No issues detected. |
| `BLUE` | Temporary minor degradation that does not affect database availability; the system is expected to return to `GREEN`. |
| `YELLOW` | A minor issue with no risks to availability. It is recommended to continue monitoring the issue. |
| `ORANGE` | A serious issue, a step away from losing availability. Maintenance may be required. |
| `RED` | A component is faulty or unavailable. |

## Possible issues {#issues}

### STORAGE_GROUP

#### Group has no vslots

**Description:** This situation is not expected; it is an internal issue.

#### Group degraded

**Description:** A number of disks allowed in the group are not available.

**Logic of work:** `HealthCheck` checks various parameters (fault tolerance mode, number of failed disks, disk status, etc.) and sets the appropriate status for the group accordingly.

**Actions:** In [Embedded UI](../embedded-ui/ydb-monitoring.md), navigate to the database page, select the `Storage` tab, apply the `Groups` and `Degraded` filters, and use the known group `id` to check the availability of nodes and disks on the nodes.

#### Group has no redundancy

**Description:** A storage group has lost its redundancy. Another VDisk failure could result in the loss of the group.

**Logic of work:** `HealthCheck` monitors various parameters (fault tolerance mode, number of failed disks, disk status, etc.) and sets the appropriate status for the group based on these parameters.

**Actions:** In [Embedded UI](../embedded-ui/ydb-monitoring.md), navigate to the database page, select the `Storage` tab, apply the `Groups` and `Degraded` filters, and use the known group `id` to check the availability of nodes and disks on those nodes.

#### Group failed

**Description:** A storage group has lost its integrity, and data is no longer available. `HealthCheck` evaluates various parameters (fault tolerance mode, number of failed disks, disk status, etc.) and determines the appropriate status, displaying a message accordingly.

**Logic of work:** `HealthCheck` monitors various parameters (fault tolerance mode, number of failed disks, disk status, etc.) and sets the appropriate status for the group accordingly.

**Actions:** In [Embedded UI](../embedded-ui/ydb-monitoring.md), navigate to the database page, select the `Storage` tab, apply the `Groups` and `Degraded` filters, and use the known group `id` to check the availability of nodes and disks on those nodes.```

### VDISK

**Actions:** In [Embedded UI](../embedded-ui/ydb-monitoring.md), navigate to the database page, select the `Storage` tab, and apply the `Groups` and `Degraded` filters. The group `id` can be found through the related `STORAGE_GROUP` issue. Hover over the relevant VDisk to identify the node with the problem and check the availability of nodes and disks on those nodes.

#### Replication in progress

**Description:** The disk is accepting queries, but not all data has been replicated.

**Actions:** In [Embedded UI](../embedded-ui/ydb-monitoring.md), navigate to the database page, select the `Storage` tab, and apply the `Groups` and `Degraded` filters. The group `id` can be found through the related `STORAGE_GROUP` issue. Hover over the relevant VDisk to identify the node with the problem and check the availability of nodes and disks on those nodes.

#### VDisk have space issue

**Description:** These issues depend solely on the underlying `PDISK` layer.

### PDISK

**Description:** `HealthCheck` the system can't parse pdisk state.

#### PDisk state is

**Description:** Indicates state of physical disk.

**Actions:** In [Embedded UI](../embedded-ui/ydb-monitoring.md), navigate to the database page, select the `Storage` tab, set the `Nodes` and `Degraded` filters, and use the known node id and PDisk to check the availability of nodes and disks on the nodes.

#### Available size is less than 12%, Available size is less than 9%, Available size is less than 6%

**Description:** Free space on the physical disk is running out.
**Actions:** In [Embedded UI](../embedded-ui/ydb-monitoring.md), navigate to the database page, select the `Storage` tab, set the `Nodes` and `Out of Space` filters, and use the known node and PDisk identifiers to check the available space.

**Description:** Quotas are exhausted.

**Actions:** Check the number of objects (tables, topics) in the database and delete any unnecessary ones.

### SYSTEM_TABLET

#### System tablet is unresponsive, System tablet response time over 1000ms, System tablet response time over 5000ms

**Description:** The system tablet is either not responding or takes too long to respond.

**Actions:** In [Embedded UI](../embedded-ui/ydb-monitoring.md), navigate to the `Storage` tab and apply the `Nodes` filter. Check the `Uptime` and the nodes' statuses. If the `Uptime` is short, review the logs to determine the reasons for the node restarts.

### TABLET

#### Tablets are restarting too often

**Description:** Tablets are restarting too frequently.

**Actions:** In [Embedded UI](../embedded-ui/ydb-monitoring.md), navigate to the `Nodes` tab. Check the `Uptime` and the nodes' statuses. If the `Uptime` is short, review the logs to determine the reasons for the node restarts.

#### Tablets/Followers are dead

**Description:** Tablets are not running (likely cannot be started).

**Actions:** In [Embedded UI](../embedded-ui/ydb-monitoring.md), navigate to the `Nodes` tab. Check the `Uptime` and the nodes' statuses. If the `Uptime` is short, review the logs to determine the reasons for the node restarts.

### LOAD_AVERAGE

#### LoadAverage above 100%

**Description:** A physical host is overloaded, meaning the system is operating at or beyond its capacity, potentially due to a high number of processes waiting for I/O operations. For more information on load, see [Load (computing)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load_(computing)).

**Logic of work:**

- Load Information:

  - Source: `/proc/loadavg`
  - The first number of the three represents the average load over the last 1 minute.

- Logical Cores Information:

  - Primary Source: `/sys/fs/cgroup/cpu.max`
  - Fallback Sources: `/sys/fs/cgroup/cpu/cpu.cfs_quota_us`, `/sys/fs/cgroup/cpu/cpu.cfs_period_us`

The number of cores is calculated by dividing the quota by the period $(quota / period)$.

**Actions:** Check the CPU load on the nodes.

### COMPUTE_POOL

#### Pool usage is over than 90%, Pool usage is over than 95%, Pool usage is over than 99%

**Description:** One of the pools' CPUs is overloaded.

**Actions:** Add cores to the configuration of the actor system for the corresponding CPU pool.

### NODE_UPTIME

#### The number of node restarts has increased

**Description:** The number of node restarts has exceeded the threshold. By default, this is set to 10 restarts per hour.

**Actions:** Check the logs to determine the reasons for the process restarts.

#### Node is restarting too often

**Description:** The number of node restarts has exceeded the threshold. By default, this is set to 30 restarts per hour.

**Actions:** Check the logs to determine the reasons for the process restarts.

### NODES_TIME_DIFFERENCE

#### Node is ... ms behind peer [id], Node is ... ms ahead of peer [id]

**Description:** Time drift on nodes might lead to potential issues with coordinating distributed transactions. This issue starts to appear when the time difference is 5 ms or more.

**Actions:** Check for discrepancies in system time between the nodes listed in the alert, and verify the operation of the time synchronization process.
