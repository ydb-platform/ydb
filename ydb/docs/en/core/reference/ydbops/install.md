# Installing ydbops

{% include [warning.md](_includes/warning.md) %}

## Download the binary from the releases page

You can download binary releases from [{#T}](../../downloads/index.md#ydbops).

## Building from source

1. Clone the `ydbops` repository from GitHub:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydbops.git
    ```

2. There are two ways to build `ydbops`:
    1. [Directly with Go](#go)
    2. [Inside a Docker container](#docker)

The second approach requires a prepared [Docker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_(software)) environment and uses the official Docker image for [Golang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(programming_language)) [v1.22](https://hub.docker.com/_/golang/tags?name=1.22), guaranteeing a successful build. The Docker container operates using the `Dockerfile` from the repository. The build process in Docker also performs additional tasks: running linter checks and substituting the version for the `ydbops` assembly to register it in the executable file.

### Building directly with Go {#go}

#### Prerequsites

[Install Go](https://go.dev/doc/install). The recommended version is 1.22.


#### Compiling

Invoke `go build` in the repository root folder:

```bash
go build
```

The `ydbops` executable will be available in the repository root folder.

#### Installing

You can copy the executable file manually or use `make`:

```bash
make install INSTALL_DIR=install_folder BUILD_DIR=.
```

### Inside a Docker container {#docker}

#### Prerequsites

- make
- [Install docker engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

#### Compiling

Invoke this command in the repository root folder:

```bash
make build-in-docker
```

The `ydbops` executables will be available in the `bin` folder. Binary files are generated for Linux and macOS (arm64, amd64).  

| Binary name            | Platform      |
|------------------------|--------------|
| ydbops                | Linux (amd64) |
| ydbops_darwin_amd64   | macOS (amd64) |
| ydbops_darwin_arm64   | macOS (arm64) |


#### Installing

To install the binary file, execute the command `make`.

Optional parameters:

- `INSTALL_DIR`: The folder where the executable file will be installed. Default value: `~/ydb/bin`.

- `BUILD_DIR`: The folder that contains the generated executable file. Use this parameter if you created the executable file manually. For example, use `BUILD_DIR=.` if the executable file is in the current working directory.

```bash
make install [INSTALL_DIR=<path_to_install_folder>] [BUILD_DIR=<path_to_build_folder>]
```

Sample command to install into `install_folder` from the current folder:

```bash
make install INSTALL_DIR=install_folder BUILD_DIR=.
```
