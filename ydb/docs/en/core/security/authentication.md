# Authentication

Once a network connection is established, the server starts to accept client requests with authentication information for processing. The server uses it to identify the client's account and to verify access to execute the query.

{% note info %}

An authentication client refers to a user undergoing the authentication process when accessing {{ ydb-short-name }}. Examples of clients include the SDK or CLI.

{% endnote %}

The following authentication modes are supported:

* [Anonymous](#anonymous) authentication.
* Authentication by [username and password](#static-credentials).
* [LDAP](#ldap-auth-provider) authentication.
* [Authentication through a third-party IAM provider](#iam), for example, [Yandex Identity and Access Management](https://cloud.yandex.com/en/docs/iam/).

## Anonymous authentication {#anonymous}

Anonymous authentication allows you to connect to {{ ydb-short-name }} without specifying any credentials like username and password. This type of access should be used only for educational purposes in local databases that cannot be accessed over the network.

However, if a user or token is specified, the corresponding authentication mode will work with subsequent authorization.

{% note warning %}

Anonymous authentication should be used only for informational purposes for local databases that are not accessible over the network.

{% endnote %}

To enable anonymous authentication, use `false` in the `enforce_user_token_requirement` key of the cluster's [configuration file](../reference/configuration/index.md#auth).

## Authenticating by username and password {#static-credentials}

This access type implies that each database user has a username and password.
Only digits and lowercase Latin letters can be used in usernames. Passwords are not restricted; even empty passwords are allowed.

The username and hashed password are stored in a table inside the authentication component. The password is hashed using the [Argon2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argon2) method. Only the system administrator has access to this table.

A token is returned in response to the username and password. Tokens have a default lifetime of 12 hours. To rotate tokens, the client, such as the [SDK](../reference/ydb-sdk/index.md), independently sends requests to the authentication service. Tokens accelerate authentication and enhance security.

Authentication by username and password includes the following steps:

1. The client accesses the database and presents their username and password to the {{ ydb-short-name }} authentication service.
1. The service validates authentication data. If the data matches, it generates a token and returns it to the authentication service.
1. The client accesses the database, presenting their token as authentication data.

To enable username/password authentication, use `true` in the `enforce_user_token_requirement` key of the cluster's [configuration file](../reference/configuration/index.md#auth).

To learn how to manage roles and users, see [{#T}](../security/authorization.md).

## LDAP directory integration {#ldap-auth-provider}

{{ ydb-short-name }} supports authentication and authorization via an [LDAP directory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LDAP). To use this feature, an LDAP directory service must be deployed and accessible from the {{ ydb-short-name }} servers.

Examples of supported LDAP implementations include [OpenLDAP](https://openldap.org/) and [Active Directory](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/active-directory/).

## Authentication through a third-party IAM provider {#iam}

* **Anonymous**: Empty token passed in a request.
* **Access Token**: Fixed token set as a parameter for the client (SDK or CLI) and passed in requests.
* **Refresh Token**: [OAuth token](https://auth0.com/blog/refresh-tokens-what-are-they-and-when-to-use-them/) of a user's personal account set as a parameter for the client (SDK or CLI), which the client periodically sends to the IAM API in the background to rotate a token (obtain a new one) to pass in requests.
* **Service Account Key**: Service account attributes and a signature key set as parameters for the client (SDK or CLI), which the client periodically sends to the IAM API in the background to rotate a token (obtain a new one) to pass in requests.
* **Metadata**: Client (SDK or CLI) periodically accesses a local service to rotate a token (obtain a new one) to pass in requests.
* **OAuth 2.0 token exchange** - The client (SDK or CLI) exchanges a token of another type for an access token using the [OAuth 2.0 token exchange protocol](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8693), then it uses the access token in {{ ydb-short-name }} API requests.

Any owner of a valid token can get access to perform operations; therefore, the principal objective of the security system is to ensure that a token remains private and to protect it from being compromised.

Authentication modes with token rotation, such as **Refresh Token** and **Service Account Key**, provide a higher level of security compared to the **Access Token** mode that uses a fixed token, since only secrets with a short validity period are transmitted to the {{ ydb-short-name }} server over the network.

The highest level of security and performance is provided when using the **Metadata** mode, since it eliminates the need to work with secrets when deploying an application and allows accessing the IAM system and caching a token in advance, before running the application.

When choosing the authentication mode among those supported by the server and environment, follow the recommendations below:

* **You would normally use Anonymous** on self-deployed local {{ ydb-short-name }} clusters that are inaccessible over the network.
* **You would use Access Token** when other modes are not supported on server side or for setup/debugging purposes. It does not require that the client access IAM. However, if the IAM system supports an API for token rotation, fixed tokens issued by this IAM usually have a short validity period, which makes it necessary to update them manually in the IAM system on a regular basis.
* **Refresh Token** can be used when performing one-time manual operations under a personal account, for example, related to DB data maintenance, performing ad-hoc operations in the CLI, or running applications from a workstation. You can manually obtain this token from IAM once to have it last a long time and save it in an environment variable on a personal workstation to use automatically and with no additional authentication parameters on CLI launch.
* **Service Account Key** is mainly used for applications designed to run in environments where the **Metadata** mode is supported, when testing them outside these environments (for example, on a workstation). It can also be used for applications outside these environments, working as an analog of **Refresh Token** for service accounts. Unlike a personal account, service account access objects and roles can be restricted.
* **Metadata** is used when deploying applications in clouds. Currently, this mode is supported on virtual machines and in {{ sf-name }} {{ yandex-cloud }}.

The token to specify in request parameters can be obtained in the IAM system that the specific {{ ydb-short-name }} deployment is associated with. In particular, {{ ydb-short-name }} in {{ yandex-cloud }} uses Yandex.Passport OAuth and {{ yandex-cloud }} service accounts. When using {{ ydb-short-name }} in a corporate context, a company's standard centralized authentication system may be used.

When using modes in which the {{ ydb-short-name }} client accesses the IAM system, the IAM URL that provides an API for issuing tokens can be set additionally. By default, existing SDKs and CLIs attempt to access the {{ yandex-cloud }} IAM API hosted at `iam.api.cloud.yandex.net:443`.

### Authentication

Authentication using the LDAP protocol is similar to the static credentials authentication process (using a login and password). The difference is that the LDAP directory acts as the authentication component. The LDAP directory is used solely to verify the login/password pair.

{% note info %}

Since the LDAP directory is an external, independent service, {{ ydb-short-name }} cannot manage user accounts within it. For successful authentication, the user must already exist in the LDAP directory. The commands `CREATE USER`, `CREATE GROUP`, `ALTER USER`, `ALTER GROUP`, `DROP USER`, and `DROP GROUP` do not affect the list of users and groups in the LDAP directory. Information on managing accounts should be found in the documentation for the specific LDAP directory implementation in use.

{% endnote %}

Currently, {{ ydb-short-name }} supports only one method of LDAP authentication, known as the `search+bind` method, which involves several steps. Upon receiving the username and password of the user being authenticated, a *bind* operation is performed using the credentials of a special service account specified in the [ldap_authentication](../reference/configuration/index.md#ldap-auth-config) section. These credentials are defined by the **bind_dn** and **bind_password** configuration parameters. After the service account is successfully authenticated, a search is conducted in the LDAP directory for the user attempting to authenticate in the system. The *search* operation is performed across the entire subtree rooted at the location specified by the **base_dn** configuration parameter and uses the filter defined in the **search_filter** configuration parameter.

Once the user entry is found, {{ ydb-short-name }} performs another *bind* operation using the found user's entry and the password provided earlier. The success of this second *bind* operation determines whether the user authentication is successful.

After successful authentication, a token is generated. This token is then used in place of the username and password, speeding up the authentication process and enhancing security.

{% note info %}

When using LDAP authentication, no user passwords are stored in {{ ydb-short-name }}.

{% endnote %}

### Token verification

After a user is authenticated in the system, a token is generated and verified before executing the requested operation. During the token verification process, the system determines on whose behalf the action is being requested and identifies the groups the user belongs to. For users from the LDAP directory, the token does not include information about group memberships. Therefore, after the token is verified, an additional query is made to the LDAP server to retrieve the list of groups the user is a member of.

Groups, like users, are entities that can have assigned access rights to perform operations on database schema objects and other resources. These assigned rights determine which operations a user is authorized to perform.

The process of retrieving a user's group list from an LDAP directory is similar to the steps taken during authentication. First, a *bind* operation is performed using the service user credentials specified by the **bind_dn** and **bind_password** parameters in the [ldap_authentication](../reference/configuration/index.md#ldap-auth-config) section of the configuration file. After successful authentication, a search is conducted for the user entry associated with the previously generated token. This search uses the **search_filter** parameter. If the user still exists, the result of the *search* operation will be a list of attribute values specified by the **requested_group_attribute** parameter. If this parameter is not set, the *memberOf* attribute is used as the default for reverse group membership. The *memberOf* attribute contains the distinguished names (DNs) of the groups to which the user belongs.

#### Group search

By default, {{ ydb-short-name }} only searches for groups in which the user is a direct member. However, by enabling the **extended_settings.enable_nested_groups_search** flag in the [ldap_authentication](../reference/configuration/index.md#ldap-auth-config) section, {{ ydb-short-name }} will attempt to retrieve groups at all levels of nesting, not just those the user directly belongs to. If {{ ydb-short-name }} is configured to work with Active Directory, the Active Directory-specific matching rule [LDAP_MATCHING_RULE_IN_CHAIN](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/adsi/search-filter-syntax?redirectedfrom=MSDN) will be used to find all nested groups. This rule allows for the retrieval of all nested groups with a single query. For LDAP servers based on OpenLDAP, group searches will be conducted using recursive graph traversal, which generally requires multiple queries. In both Active Directory and OpenLDAP configurations, the group search is performed only within the subtree specified by the **base_dn** parameter.

{% note info %}

In the current implementation, the group names that {{ ydb-short-name }} uses match the values stored in the *memberOf* attribute. These names can be long and difficult to read.

Example:

```text
cn=Developers,ou=Groups,dc=mycompany,dc=net@ldap
```

{% endnote %}

{% note info %}

In the configuration file section that specifies authentication information, the refresh rate for user and group information can be set using the **refresh_time** parameter. For more detailed information about configuration files, refer to the [cluster configuration](../reference/configuration/index.md#auth-config) section.

{% endnote %}

{% note warning %}

It should be noted that currently, {{ ydb-short-name }} does not have the capability to track group renaming on the LDAP server side. Consequently, a group with a new name will not retain the rights assigned to the group under its previous name.

{% endnote %}

### LDAP users and groups in {{ ydb-short-name }}

Since {{ ydb-short-name }} supports various methods of user authentication (login and password authentication, IAM provider usage, LDAP directory), it is often helpful to identify the specific source of authentication when handling user and group names. For all authentication types except login and password, a suffix in the format `<username>@<domain>` is appended to user and group names.

For LDAP users, the `<domain>` is determined by the **ldap_authentication_domain** configuration parameter in the [configuration section](../reference/configuration/index.md#ldap-auth-config). By default, this parameter is set to `ldap`, so all usernames authenticated through the LDAP directory, as well as their corresponding group names in {{ ydb-short-name }}, will follow this format:

- `user1@ldap`
- `group1@ldap`
- `group2@ldap`

{% note warning %}

To indicate that the entered login should be recognized as a username from the LDAP directory, rather than for login and password authentication, you need to append the LDAP authentication domain suffix. This suffix is specified through the **ldap_authentication_domain** configuration parameter.

Below are examples of authenticating the user `user1` using the [{{ ydb-short-name }} CLI](../reference/ydb-cli/index.md):

* Authentication of a user from the LDAP directory: `ydb --user user1@ldap -p ydb_profile scheme ls`
* Authentication of a user using the internal {{ ydb-short-name }} mechanism: `ydb --user user1 -p ydb_profile scheme ls`

{% endnote %}

### TLS connection {#ldap-tls}

Depending on the specified configuration parameters, {{ ydb-short-name }} can establish either an encrypted or unencrypted connection. An encrypted connection with the LDAP server is established using the TLS protocol, which is recommended for production clusters. There are two ways to enable a TLS connection:

* Automatically via the [`ldaps`](#ldaps) connection scheme.
* Using the [`StartTls`](#starttls) LDAP protocol extension*.

When using an unencrypted connection, all data transmitted in requests to the LDAP server, including passwords, will be sent in plain text. This method is easier to set up and is more suited for experimentation or testing purposes.

#### LDAPS {#ldaps}

To have {{ ydb-short-name }} automatically establish an encrypted connection with the LDAP server, the **scheme** value in the [configuration parameter](../reference/configuration/index.md#ldap-auth-config) should be set to `ldaps`. The TLS handshake will be initiated on the port specified in the configuration. If no port is specified, the default port 636 will be used for the `ldaps` scheme. The LDAP server must be configured to accept TLS connections on the specified ports.

#### LDAP protocol extension `StartTls` {#starttls}

`StartTls` is an LDAP protocol extension that enables message encryption using the TLS protocol. It allows a combination of encrypted and plain-text message transmission within a single connection to the LDAP server. {{ ydb-short-name }} sends a `StartTls` request to the LDAP server to initiate a TLS connection. In {{ ydb-short-name }}, enabling or disabling TLS within an active session is not supported. Therefore, once an encrypted connection is established using `StartTls`, all subsequent messages sent to the LDAP server will be encrypted. One advantage of using this extension, provided the LDAP server is appropriately configured, is the capability to initiate a TLS connection over an unencrypted port. The extension can be enabled in the [`use_tls` section](../reference/configuration/index.md#ldap-auth-config) of the configuration file.
