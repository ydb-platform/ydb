# YQL - Overview

*YQL* ({{ ydb-short-name }} Query Language) is a universal declarative query language for {{ ydb-short-name }}, a dialect of SQL. YQL has been natively designed for large distributed databases, and therefore has a number of differences from the SQL standard.

{{ ydb-short-name }} tools support interfaces for sending YQL queries and receiving their execution results:

- [YDB CLI](../../../../reference/ydb-cli/index.md)
- [YDB SDK](../../../../reference/ydb-sdk/index.md)

This documentation section contains the YQL reference that includes the sections:

- [Data types](../../types/index.md) with a description of data types used in YQL
- [Syntax](../../syntax/index.md) with a full list of YQL commands
- [Built-in functions](../../builtins/index.md) with a description of the available built-in functions

You can also take a tutorial to get familiar with the basic YQL commands, in the [YQL tutorial](../../../../dev/yql-tutorial/index.md) section.
