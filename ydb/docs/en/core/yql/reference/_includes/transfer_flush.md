Table write batching parameters let you balance the latency of records appearing in the table against the resources required by the transfer. Batching parameters affect the processing of each topic partition independently. Change batching parameters with caution, as this can either improve or degrade message stream processing speed, and may even lead to a denial of service if the parameters are misconfigured. For example, writing to the table in small batches can overload the table and degrade its performance, while an excessively large batch size can cause the server to run out of available memory.

*   `BATCH_SIZE_BYTES` — the batch size in bytes. Default: 8 MB.
*   `FLUSH_INTERVAL` — the table write interval. Default: 60 seconds. Data is written to the table at this interval, even if the batch has not reached the size specified in the `BATCH_SIZE_BYTES` parameter.
