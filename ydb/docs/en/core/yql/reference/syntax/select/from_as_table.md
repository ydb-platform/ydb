## FROM AS_TABLE {#as-table}

Accessing named expressions as tables using the `AS_TABLE` function.

`AS_TABLE($variable)` lets you use the value of `$variable` as the data source for the query. In this case, the variable `$variable` must have the type `List<Struct<...>>`.

### Example

```yql
$data = AsList(
    AsStruct(1u AS Key, "v1" AS Value),
    AsStruct(2u AS Key, "v2" AS Value),
    AsStruct(3u AS Key, "v3" AS Value));

SELECT Key, Value FROM AS_TABLE($data);
```

You should explicitly specify column names in both the source and the target when using expressions with modifying queries such as [UPSERT INTO](../upsert_into.md) or [INSERT INTO](../insert_into.md):

```yql
$data = AsList(
    AsStruct(1u AS Key, "v1" AS Value),
    AsStruct(2u AS Key, "v2" AS Value),
    AsStruct(3u AS Key, "v3" AS Value));

INSERT INTO `my_table` (Key, Value) SELECT Key, Value FROM AS_TABLE($data);
```

Alternatively, you can omit them entirely:

```yql
$data = AsList(
    AsStruct(1u AS Key, "v1" AS Value),
    AsStruct(2u AS Key, "v2" AS Value),
    AsStruct(3u AS Key, "v3" AS Value));

INSERT INTO `my_table` SELECT * FROM AS_TABLE($data);
```
