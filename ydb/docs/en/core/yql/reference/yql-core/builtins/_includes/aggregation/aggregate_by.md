## AGGREGATE_BY and MULTI_AGGREGATE_BY {#aggregate-by}

Applying an [aggregation factory](../../basic.md#aggregationfactory) to all values of a column or expression. The `MULTI_AGGREGATE_BY` function requires that the value of a column or expression has a structure, tuple, or list, and applies the factory to each individual element, placing the result in a container of the same format. If different values of a column or expression contain lists of different length, the resulting list will have the smallest of the source lengths.

1. Column, `DISTINCT` column or expression.
2. Factory.

### Examples

```yql
$count_factory = AggregationFactory("COUNT");

SELECT
    AGGREGATE_BY(DISTINCT column, $count_factory) as uniq_count
FROM my_table;

SELECT
    MULTI_AGGREGATE_BY(nums, AggregationFactory("count")) as count,
    MULTI_AGGREGATE_BY(nums, AggregationFactory("min")) as min,
    MULTI_AGGREGATE_BY(nums, AggregationFactory("max")) as max,
    MULTI_AGGREGATE_BY(nums, AggregationFactory("avg")) as avg,
    MULTI_AGGREGATE_BY(nums, AggregationFactory("percentile", 0.9)) as p90
FROM my_table;
```
