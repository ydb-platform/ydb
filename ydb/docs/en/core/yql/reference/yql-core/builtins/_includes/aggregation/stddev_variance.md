## STDDEV and VARIANCE {#stddev-variance}

Standard deviation and variance in a column. Those functions use a [single-pass parallel algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithms_for_calculating_variance#Parallel_algorithm), whose result may differ from the more common methods requiring two passes through the data.

By default, the sample variance and standard deviation are calculated. Several write methods are available:

* with the `POPULATION` suffix/prefix, for example: `VARIANCE_POPULATION`, `POPULATION_VARIANCE` calculates the variance or standard deviation for the population.
* With the `SAMPLE` suffix/prefix or without a suffix, for example, `VARIANCE_SAMPLE`, `SAMPLE_VARIANCE`, `SAMPLE` calculate sample variance and standard deviation.

Several abbreviated aliases are also defined, for example, `VARPOP` or `STDDEVSAMP`.

If all the values passed are `NULL`, it returns `NULL`.

### Examples

```yql
SELECT
  STDDEV(numeric_column),
  VARIANCE(numeric_column)
FROM my_table;
```
