## Access to the metadata of the current operation {#metadata}

When you run YQL operations via the web interface or HTTP API, you get access to the following data:

* `CurrentOperationId()`: The private ID of the operation.
* `CurrentOperationSharedId()`: The public ID of the operation.
* `CurrentAuthenticatedUser()`: The username of the current user.

No arguments.

If this data is missing, for example, when you run operations in the embedded mode, the functions return an empty string.

### Examples

```yql
SELECT
    CurrentOperationId(),
    CurrentOperationSharedId(),
    CurrentAuthenticatedUser();
```
