## Pickle, Unpickle {#pickle}

`Pickle()` and `StablePickle()` serialize an arbitrary object into a sequence of bytes, if possible. Typical non-serializable objects are Callable and Resource. The serialization format is not versioned and can be used within a single query. For the Dict type, the StablePickle function pre-sorts the keys, and for Pickle, the order of dictionary elements in the serialized representation isn't defined.

`Unpickle()` is the inverse operation (deserialization), where with the first argument being the data type of the result and the second argument is the string with the result of `Pickle()` or `StablePickle()`.

### Examples

```yql
SELECT *
FROM my_table
WHERE Digest::MurMurHash32(
        Pickle(TableRow())
    ) %10 ==0; -- actually, it is better to use TABLESAMPLE

$buf = Pickle(123);
SELECT Unpickle(Int32, $buf);
```
