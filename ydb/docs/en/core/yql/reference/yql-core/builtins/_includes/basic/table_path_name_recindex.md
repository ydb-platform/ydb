## TablePath {#tablepath}

Access to the current table name, which might be needed when you use [CONCAT](../../../syntax/select.md#concat), [RANGE](../../../syntax/select.md#range), and other related functions.

No arguments. Returns a string with the full path or an empty string and warning when used in an unsupported context (for example, when working with a subquery or a range of 1000+ tables).

{% note info %}

The [TablePath](#tablepath), [TableName](#tablename), and [TableRecordIndex](#tablerecordindex) functions don't support temporary and anonymous tables (they return an empty string or 0 for [TableRecordIndex](#tablerecordindex)).
These functions are calculated when [executing](../../../syntax/select.md#selectexec) projections in `SELECT`, and by that time the current table may already be temporary.
To avoid such a situation, create a subquery for calculating these functions, as shown in the second example below.

{% endnote %}

### Examples

```yql
SELECT TablePath() FROM CONCAT(table_a, table_b);
```

```yql
SELECT key, tpath_ AS path FROM (SELECT a.*, TablePath() AS tpath_ FROM RANGE(`my_folder`) AS a)
WHERE key IN $subquery;
```

## TableName {#tablename}

Get the table name based on the table path. You can obtain the path using the [TablePath](#tablepath) function or as the `Path` column when using the table function [FOLDER](../../../syntax/select.md#folder).

Optional arguments:

* Path to the table, `TablePath()` is used by default (see also its limitations).
* Specifying the system ("yt") whose rules are used to determine the table name. You need to specify the system only if [USE](../../../syntax/select.md#use) doesn't specify the current cluster.

### Examples

```yql
USE hahn;
SELECT TableName() FROM CONCAT(table_a, table_b);
```

```yql
SELECT TableName(Path, "yt") FROM hahn.FOLDER(folder_name);
```

## TableRecordIndex {#tablerecordindex}

Access to the current sequence number of a row in the physical source table, **starting from 1** (depends on the storage implementation).

No arguments. When used in combination with [CONCAT](../../../syntax/select.md#concat), [RANGE](../../../syntax/select.md#range) and other similar mechanisms, numbering restarts for each input table. If used in an incorrect context, it returns 0.

### Example

```yql
SELECT TableRecordIndex() FROM my_table;
```
