## FIRST_VALUE / LAST_VALUE

Access values from the first and last rows (using the `ORDER BY` clause for the window) of the [window frame](../../../syntax/window.md#frame). The only argument is the expression that you need to access.

Optionally, `OVER` can be preceded by the additional modifier `IGNORE NULLS`. It changes the behavior of functions to the first or last **non-empty** (i.e., non-`NULL`) value among the window frame rows. The antonym of this modifier is `RESPECT NULLS`: it's the default behavior that can be omitted.

### Signature

```yql
FIRST_VALUE(T)->T?
LAST_VALUE(T)->T?
```

### Examples

```yql
SELECT
   FIRST_VALUE(my_column) OVER w
FROM my_table
WINDOW w AS (ORDER BY key);
```

```yql
SELECT
   LAST_VALUE(my_column) IGNORE NULLS OVER w
FROM my_table
WINDOW w AS (ORDER BY key);
```
