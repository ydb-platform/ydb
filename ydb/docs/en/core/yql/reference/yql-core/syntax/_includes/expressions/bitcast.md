## BITCAST {#bitcast}

Performs a bitwise conversion of an integer value to the specified integer type. The conversion is always successful, but may lose precision or high-order bits.

### Examples

```yql
SELECT
    BITCAST(100000ul AS Uint32),     -- 100000
    BITCAST(100000ul AS Int16),      -- -31072
    BITCAST(100000ul AS Uint16),     -- 34464
    BITCAST(-1 AS Int16),            -- -1
    BITCAST(-1 AS Uint16);           -- 65535
```
