## Accessing containers {#items-access}

For accessing the values inside containers:

* `Struct<>`, `Tuple<>` and `Variant<>`, use a **dot**. The set of keys (for the tuple and the corresponding variant â€” indexes) is known at the query compilation time. The key is **validated** before beginning the query execution.
* `List<>` and `Dict<>`, use **square brackets**. The set of keys (set of indexes for keys) is known only at the query execution time. The key is **not validated** before beginning the query execution. If no value is found, an empty value (NULL) is returned.

[Description and list of available containers](../../../types/containers.md).

When using this syntax to access containers within table columns, be sure to specify the full column name, including the table name or table alias separated by a dot (see the first example below).

### Examples

```yql
SELECT
  t.struct.member,
  t.tuple.7,
  t.dict["key"],
  t.list[7]
FROM my_table AS t;
```

```yql
SELECT
  Sample::ReturnsStruct().member;
```
