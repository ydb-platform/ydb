## Lambda functions {#lambda}

Let you combine multiple expressions into a single callable value.

List arguments in round brackets, following them by the arrow and lambda function body. The lambda function body includes either an expression in round brackets or curly brackets around an optional chain of [named expressions](../../../syntax/expressions.md#named-nodes) assignments and the call result after the `RETURN` keyword in the last expression.

The scope for the lambda body: first the local named expressions, then arguments, then named expressions defined above by the lambda function at the top level of the query.

Only use pure expressions inside the lambda body (those might also be other lambdas, possibly passed through arguments). However, you can't use [SELECT](../../select/index.md), [INSERT INTO](../../insert_into.md), or other top-level expressions.

One or more of the last lambda parameters can be marked with a question mark as optional: if they haven't been specified when calling lambda, they are assigned the `NULL` value.

### Examples

```yql
$f = ($y) -> {
    $prefix = "x";
    RETURN $prefix || $y;
};

$g = ($y) -> ("x" || $y);

$h = ($x, $y?) -> ($x + ($y ?? 0));

SELECT $f("y"), $g("z"), $h(1), $h(2, 3); -- "xy", "xz", 1, 5
```

```yql
-- if the lambda result is calculated by a single expression, then you can use a more compact syntax:
$f = ($x, $_) -> ($x || "suffix"); -- the second argument is not used
SELECT $f("prefix_", "whatever");
```
