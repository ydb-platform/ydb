## Table expressions {#table-contexts}

A table expression is an expression that returns a table. Table expressions in YQL are as follows:

* Subqueries: `(SELECT key, subkey FROM T)`
* [Named subqueries](../../../syntax/expressions.md#named-nodes): `$foo = SELECT * FROM T;` (in this case, `$foo` is also a table expression)
{% if feature_subquery %}
* [Subquery templates](../../subquery.md#define-subquery): `DEFINE SUBQUERY $foo($name) AS ... END DEFINE;` (`$foo("InputTable")` is a table expression).
{% endif %}

Semantics of a table expression depends on the context where it is used. In YQL, table expressions can be used in the following contexts:

* Table context: after [FROM](../../select/from.md).
In this case, table expressions work as expected: for example, `$input = SELECT a, b, c FROM T; SELECT * FROM $input` returns a table with three columns.
The table context also occurs after [UNION ALL](../../select/union.md#unionall){% if feature_join %}, [JOIN](../../join.md#join){% endif %}{% if feature_mapreduce and process_command == "PROCESS" %}, [PROCESS](../../process.md#process), [REDUCE](../../reduce.md#reduce){% endif %};
* Vector context: after [IN](../../../syntax/expressions.md#in). In this context, the table expression must contain exactly one column (the name of this column doesn't affect the expression result in any way).
A table expression in a vector context is typed as a list (the type of the list element is the same as the column type in this case). Example: `SELECT * FROM T WHERE key IN (SELECT k FROM T1)`;
* A scalar context arises _in all the other cases_. As in a vector context, a table expression must contain exactly one column, but the value of the table expression is a scalar, that is, an arbitrarily selected value of this column (if no rows are returned, the result is `NULL`). Example: `$count = SELECT COUNT(*) FROM T; SELECT * FROM T ORDER BY key LIMIT $count / 2`;

The order of rows in a table context, the order of elements in a vector context, and the rule for selecting a value from a scalar context (if multiple values are returned), aren't defined. This order also cannot be affected by `ORDER BY`: `ORDER BY` without `LIMIT` is ignored in table expressions with a warning, and `ORDER BY` with `LIMIT` defines a set of elements rather than the order within that set.

{% if feature_mapreduce and process_command == "PROCESS" %}

There is an exception to this rule. Named expression with [PROCESS](../../process.md#process), if used in a scalar context, behaves as in a table context:

```yql
$input = SELECT 1 AS key, 2 AS value;
$process = PROCESS $input;

SELECT FormatType(TypeOf($process)); -- $process is used in a scalar context,
                                     -- but the SELECT result in this case is List<Struct'key':Int32,'value':Int32>

SELECT $process[0].key; -- that returns 1

SELECT FormatType(TypeOf($input)); -- throws an error: $input in a scalar context must contain one column
```

{% note warning "Warning" %}

A common error is to use an expression in a scalar context rather than a table context or vector context. For example:

```yql
$dict = SELECT key, value FROM T1;

DEFINE SUBQUERY $merge_dict($table, $dict) AS
SELECT * FROM $table LEFT JOIN $dict USING(key);
END DEFINE;

SELECT * FROM $merge_dict("Input", $dict); -- $dict is used in a scalar context in this case.
                                           -- an error: exactly one column is expected in a scalar context
```

A correct notation in this case is:

```yql
DEFINE SUBQUERY $dict() AS
SELECT key, value FROM T1;
END DEFINE;

DEFINE SUBQUERY $merge_dict($table, $dict) AS
SELECT * FROM $table LEFT JOIN $dict() USING(key); -- Using the table expression $dict()
                                                   -- (Calling a subquery template) in a table context
END DEFINE;

SELECT * FROM $merge_dict("Input", $dict); -- $dict - is a subquery template (rather than a table expression)
                                           -- that is passed as an argument of a table expression
```
