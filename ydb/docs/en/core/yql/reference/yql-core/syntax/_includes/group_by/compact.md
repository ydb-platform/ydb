## GROUP COMPACT BY

Improves aggregation efficiency if the query author knows in advance that none of aggregation keys finds large amounts of data (i.e., with the order of magnitude exceeding a gigabyte or a million of rows). If this assumption fails to materialize, then the operation may fail with Out of Memory error or start running much slower compared to the non-COMPACT version.

Unlike the usual GROUP BY, the Map-side combiner stage and additional Reduce are disabled for each field with [DISTINCT](../../../syntax/group_by.md#distinct) aggregation.

### Example

```yql
SELECT
  key,
  COUNT (DISTINCT value) AS count -- top 3 keys by the number of unique values
FROM my_table
GROUP COMPACT BY key
ORDER BY count DESC
LIMIT 3;
```
