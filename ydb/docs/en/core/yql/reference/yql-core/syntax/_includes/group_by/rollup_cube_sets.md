## ROLLUP, CUBE, and GROUPING SETS {#rollup}

The results of calculating the aggregate function as subtotals for the groups and overall totals over individual columns or whole table.

### Syntax

```yql
SELECT
    c1, c2, -- the columns to group by

AGGREGATE_FUNCTION(c3) AS outcome_c  -- an aggregate function (SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX, COUNT)

FROM table_name

GROUP BY
    GROUP_BY_EXTENSION(c1, c2)       -- an extension of GROUP BY: ROLLUP, CUBE, or GROUPING SETS
```

* `ROLLUP` groups the column values in the order they are listed in the arguments (strictly from left to right), generates subtotals for each group and the overall total.
* `CUBE` groups the values for every possible combination of columns, generates the subtotals for each group and the overall total.
* `GROUPING SETS` sets the groups for subtotals.

You can combine `ROLLUP`, `CUBE` and `GROUPING SETS`, separating them by commas.

### GROUPING {#grouping}

The values of columns not used in calculations are replaced with `NULL` in the subtotal. In the overall total, the values of all columns are replaced by `NULL`. `GROUPING`: A function that allows you to distinguish the source `NULL` values from the `NULL` values added while calculating subtotals and overall totals.

`GROUPING` returns a bit mask:

* `0`: If `NULL` is used for the original empty value.
* `1`: If `NULL` is added for a subtotal or overall total.

### Example

```yql
SELECT
    column1,
    column2,
    column3,

    CASE GROUPING(
        column1,
        column2,
        column3,
    )
        WHEN 1  THEN "Subtotal: column1 and column2"
        WHEN 3  THEN "Subtotal: column1"
        WHEN 4  THEN "Subtotal: column2 and column3"
        WHEN 6  THEN "Subtotal: column3"
        WHEN 7  THEN "Grand total"
        ELSE         "Individual group"
    END AS subtotal,

    COUNT(*) AS rows_count

FROM my_table

GROUP BY
    ROLLUP(
        column1,
        column2,
        column3
    ),
    GROUPING SETS(
        (column2, column3),
        (column3)
        -- if you add here (column2) as well, then together
        -- the ROLLUP and GROUPING SETS would produce a result
        -- similar to CUBE
    )
;
```
