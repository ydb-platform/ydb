# INSERT INTO

{% if select_command != "SELECT STREAM" %} Adds rows to the table. {% if feature_bulk_tables %} If the target table already exists and is not sorted, the operation `INSERT INTO` adds rows at the end of the table. In the case of a sorted table, YQL tries to preserve sorting by running a sorted merge. {% endif %}{% if feature_map_tables %} If you try to insert a row into a table with an existing primary key value, the operation fails with the `PRECONDITION_FAILED` error code and the `Operation aborted due to constraint violation: insert_pk` message returned.{% endif %}

{% if feature_mapreduce %}The table is searched by name in the database specified by the [USE](../use.md) operator.{% endif %}

`INSERT INTO` lets you perform the following operations:

* Adding constant values using [`VALUES`](../values.md).

```yql
  INSERT INTO my_table (Key1, Key2, Value1, Value2)
  VALUES (345987,'ydb', 'Pied piper', 1414);
  COMMIT;
  ```

```yql
  INSERT INTO my_table (key, value)
  VALUES ("foo", 1), ("bar", 2);
  ```

* Saving the `SELECT` result.

```yql
  INSERT INTO my_table
  SELECT Key AS Key1, "Empty" AS Key2, Value AS Value1
  FROM my_table1;
  ```

{% else %}

Send the result of the [SELECT STREAM](../select_stream.md) calculation to the specified stream on the cluster specified by the [USE](../use.md) operator. The stream must exist and have a scheme matching the query result.

## Examples

```yql
INSERT INTO my_stream_dst
SELECT STREAM key FROM my_stream_src;
```

You can specify a table on a {{ ydb-short-name }} cluster as the target. The table must exist at the time you create the operation. The table schema must be compatible with the type of query result.


```yql
INSERT INTO ydb_cluster.`my_table_dst`
SELECT STREAM * FROM rtmr_cluster.`my_stream_source`;
```

{% endif %}
