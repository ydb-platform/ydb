# LIMIT and OFFSET

`LIMIT`: limits the output to the specified number of rows. By default, the output is not restricted.

`OFFSET`: specifies the offset from the beginning (in rows). By default, it's zero.

## Examples

```yql
SELECT key FROM my_table
LIMIT 7;
```

```yql
SELECT key FROM my_table
LIMIT 7 OFFSET 3;
```

```yql
SELECT key FROM my_table
LIMIT 3, 7; -- equivalent to the previous example
```
