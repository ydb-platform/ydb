## UNION {#union}

Union of the results of the underlying queries, with duplicates removed.
Behavior is identical to using `UNION ALL` followed by `SELECT DISTINCT *`.
Refer to [UNION ALL](../../select/union.md#union-all) for more details.

**Примеры**

```yql
SELECT key FROM T1
UNION
SELECT key FROM T2 -- returns the set of distinct keys in the tables
```
