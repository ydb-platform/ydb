Customer_Address
CA

One row for each unique customer location\
\
Describes physical location of the customer\
\
Data generator enforces constraint that customers with same household demographic will have the same address (since at this point we define household as customers with the same address)  This was originally enforced by having each row in\\
 this table contain a reference to a household demographic entry.  This created several strange linkages in other tables that contained both addresses and household demographics.
Remove reference to household demographics. Data generator will enforce constraint that customers with the same household demographics will have the same address.\
\
Possible candidate for refresh function:  find and remove stale entries.

Customer_Demographics
CD

One row for each unique combination of customer demographics.\
\
The values in this table represent "RAW" answers provided by a customer in response to demographic questions.
Purchase band is not defined.\
To be consistent with the income band referenced from household demographics this would be a separate dimension.  Do we really want to move to the snowflake model?

Item
I


1. In column descriptions, remove all references to Product and Product_ID, since these columns have been deleted.  Also delete PRODUCT_NAME column completely.\
\
2. Research problem:  explore functions that map from item upwards to higher levels of hierarchy, and maintain proper inclusion (i.e. if Item 1,2 and 3 are in Class A, and Item 4,5, and 6 are in Class B, we should never map Item 2 to any\\
 other class but A.  A possible approach is:\
\
item ID mod 1000 = subclass_ID, then subclass_ID mod 200 = class_ID, etc.  This maintains inclusion, but has the perhaps undesirable property that every subclass has the same number of items, every class has the same number of subclasses,\\
 etc.  In other words, the "tree" describing the hierarchy is perfectly balanced at all levels.\
\
A way to "unbalance" the tree at the top level would be to only use the "mod" approach up to and including selecting the Class of a generated item.  After that, use statically generated mappings of Category->subcategory->class that contain\\
 skew.  I.e. some categories have more subcategories than others, some subcats. have more classes than others.  \
\
In any case, decide how many distinct values there are for each hierarchy_ID column.  In the above approach, doing mod 10 gives 10 distinct values for a given level.  Need to specify this at all levels of the hierarchy.\
\
3. Assign textual strings to hierarchy description columns (category, subcategory, class, subclass, brand, item).  One idea is to use statically generated mappings *and* names (see above) for category->subcategory->class based on common\\
 retail departments.  For the lower levels of the hierarchy, one could do the following:\
\
Class nnn gets the name concat(category_name, subcategory_name, "classnnn")\
Subclass xxx gets the name "SBCLxxxx"\
Brandyyy gets concat("SBCLxxxx", BRANDyyyyyy") where Brand yyyy is in Subclass xxx. \
Item zzz gets name concat ("SBCLxxx", "BRANDyyyyy", "ITEMzzzz") where Item zzz has been determined (using the function defined in "research problem", above) to be in Brand yyyy and Subclass xxxx).\
\
4.) The hierarchy item->brand->manufacturer is somewhat separate.  Need to define a function to map brand_id to manufacturer_ID, and decide on a manufacturer name.  As above, one could simply say that manufacturer xxx is named\\
 "MANUFACTURERxxx".\
\
5.) There are a number of attribute columns that don't apply to every conceivable item.  For example, Flavor would only apply to food items, etc.  One approach would be to mandate during generation that the population (or lack thereof) of\\
 the attribute column would depend on category membership of the item.  For example, if an item is in the Clothing category, we would populate the (size and unit) columns.  If an item is in the Food category, we might populate the (size,\\
 flavor, container) columns.  If a column is not to be populated (because of "category mismatch), we would populate it with a value that means "not applicable".   Need to specify column domains for each of: formulation, flavor, size,\\
 container, units.\
\
6.) Need to decide how many product managers there are.

Date_Dim
D

Table of dates.\
Values in almost all fields in this table can be derived. It is used to simplify queries.
Things to do:\
- we may want to add the following columns\
Previous Day, Week, Month, Quarter, Year\
Next Day, Week, Month, Quarter, Year\
\
- as we are developing queries we may add additional unspecified columns\
\
- it is not clear if we want to design the table so that it needs update periodically. We need to decide if we really need this, if such maintenance pays of by writing simpler SQL

It seems like the last 20 byte fields (shift,sub-shift and meal time) should be in a separate small dimension tables, and the TIME table itself should contain only a code here. But the additional space is only 0.5 MB anyway.\

c_customer_id
C_CUSTOMER_ID

Sales and returns point to the customer table by this id. They also point to the address and demo information in effect at the time of the sale or return.  The customer row has within it information that may change over time, but we are\\
 only interested in knowing the current state (like the name today  - we don't need to save somone's maiden name).  Changing data (addresses, demographics) are broken out into separate tables so that their history can be maintained).  \
\
When a customer column changes occur, the row is updated.  For address and demographics,  the pointers to the Demographics or Address tables are updated (and address rows added).  This way, we seldom add customer records, *and* keep\\
 historical information for sales/returns, and can easily discern the current state of a customer.  Probably should offer users a view called "current customer" which is a prejoin of these three tables.\
\
It is possible for a row to be in the customer table without any sales for the customer. \
\
There needs to be a well-known  identifier for an UNKNOWN customer.

We are not pointing to the date table for this information.  Otherwise, we would need a life-time's worth of date rows in the table.  There is no space issue doing this, it just seems a little silly keeping 120 years worth of days in date. \\
 On the other hand, it might be nice for display purposes to have all the ways of expressing the date that is found in the date table.

d_date_id
D_DATE_ID

Generated field. \
\
RESERVE ZERO, as zero has special meaning for date_ids found in end_date fields to mean "current"\
\
The meaning of the date depends on the context.  For example,  when the sales table date field ss_sold_date_id points this row, it refers to the date sold relative to the store where it was sold.  When the catalog sales table\\
 cs_sold_date_id points to this row, it is the date at the call center when the item was sold, and cs_cust_date_id is the date at the customer location when it was sold.  Some dimension tables use this id when identifying a date, such as\\
 the season table.\
\
Our calendar is "date grane based calendar" not for example fiscal year calendar. This implies that we have two hierarchies:\
date --> week\
date ---> month ---> quarter ---> year

ss_ticket_number
SS_TICKET_NUMBER

This is a number that is assigned at the time of the sale at the store.  The register ticket combined with the store, date (store date), and  time make up a unique key of this table.  It breaks the tie if two unknown customers have a sales\\
 recorded at the same second in the same store.\
\
Ticket numbers are unique within the same store for the same day (at the store).  For data generation, it can be even more unique than that, but it needs to be atleast that unique.\
\
This is a degenerate dimension, as all the other information at the time of sale ends up in other dimensions.

This is the quantity of this item sold on this register ticket.\

For data generation care must be taken to choose quantity so that the other numbers say in range as all the columns named " *_exp*" are a multiple of this column.   Note that  ss_net_paid, ss_net_paid_inc_tax, and ss_net_profit are computed\\
 from columns that are multiples of this column.
