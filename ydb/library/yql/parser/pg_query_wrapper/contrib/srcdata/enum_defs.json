(Only explicit JOIN syntax\n *\t  produces an RTE, not the implicit join resulting from multiple FROM\n *\t  items.  This is because we only need the RTE to deal with SQL features\n *\t  like outer joins and join-output-column aliasing.)  Other special\n *\t  RTE types also exist, as indicated by RTEKind.\n *\n *\t  Note that we consider RTE_RELATION to cover anything that has a pg_class\n *\t  entry.  relkind distinguishes the sub-cases.\n *\n *\t  alias is an Alias node representing the AS alias-clause attached to the\n *\t  FROM expression, or NULL if no clause.\n *\n *\t  eref is the table reference name and column reference names (either\n *\t  real or aliases).  Note that system columns (OID etc) are not included\n *\t  in the column list.\n *\t  eref->aliasname is required to be present, and should generally be used\n *\t  to identify the RTE for error messages etc.\n *\n *\t  In RELATION RTEs, the colnames in both alias and eref are indexed by\n *\t  physical attribute number; this means there must be colname entries for\n *\t  dropped columns.  When building an RTE we insert empty strings (\"\") for\n *\t  dropped columns.  Note however that a stored rule may have nonempty\n *\t  colnames for columns dropped since the rule was created (and for that\n *\t  matter the colnames might be out of date due to column renamings).\n *\t  The same comments apply to FUNCTION RTEs when a function's return type\n *\t  is a named composite type.\n *\n *\t  In JOIN RTEs, the colnames in both alias and eref are one-to-one with\n *\t  joinaliasvars entries.  A JOIN RTE will omit columns of its inputs when\n *\t  those columns are known to be dropped at parse time.  Again, however,\n *\t  a stored rule might contain entries for columns dropped since the rule\n *\t  was created.  (This is only possible for columns not actually referenced\n *\t  in the rule.)  When loading a stored rule, we replace the joinaliasvars\n *\t  items for any such columns with null pointers.  (We can't simply delete\n *\t  them from the joinaliasvars list, because that would affect the attnums\n *\t  of Vars referencing the rest of the list.)\n *\n *\t  inh is true for relation references that should be expanded to include\n *\t  inheritance children, if the rel has any.  This *must* be false for\n *\t  RTEs other than RTE_RELATION entries.\n *\n *\t  inFromCl marks those range variables that are listed in the FROM clause.\n *\t  It's false for RTEs that are added to a query behind the scenes, such\n *\t  as the NEW and OLD variables for a rule, or the subqueries of a UNION.\n *\t  This flag is not used anymore during parsing, since the parser now uses\n *\t  a separate \"namespace\" data structure to control visibility, but it is\n *\t  needed by ruleutils.c to determine whether RTEs should be shown in\n *\t  decompiled queries.\n *\n *\t  requiredPerms and checkAsUser specify run-time access permissions\n *\t  checks to be performed at query startup.  The user must have *all*\n *\t  of the permissions that are OR'd together in requiredPerms (zero\n *\t  indicates no permissions checking).  If checkAsUser is not zero,\n *\t  then do the permissions checks using the access rights of that user,\n *\t  not the current effective user ID.  (This allows rules to act as\n *\t  setuid gateways.)  Permissions checks only apply to RELATION RTEs.\n *\n *\t  For SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE permissions, if the user doesn't have\n *\t  table-wide permissions then it is sufficient to have the permissions\n *\t  on all columns identified in selectedCols (for SELECT) and/or\n *\t  insertedCols and/or updatedCols (INSERT with ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE may\n *\t  have all 3).  selectedCols, insertedCols and updatedCols are bitmapsets,\n *\t  which cannot have negative integer members, so we subtract\n *\t  FirstLowInvalidHeapAttributeNumber from column numbers before storing\n *\t  them in these fields.  A whole-row Var reference is represented by\n *\t  setting the bit for InvalidAttrNumber.\n *\n *\t  updatedCols is also used in some other places, for example, to determine\n *\t  which triggers to fire and in FDWs to know which changed columns they\n *\t  need to ship off.\n *\n *\t  Generated columns that are caused to be updated by an update to a base\n *\t  column are listed in extraUpdatedCols.  This is not considered for\n *\t  permission checking, but it is useful in those places that want to know\n *\t  the full set of columns being updated as opposed to only the ones the\n *\t  user explicitly mentioned in the query.  (There is currently no need for\n *\t  an extraInsertedCols, but it could exist.)  Note that extraUpdatedCols\n *\t  is populated during query rewrite, NOT in the parser, since generated\n *\t  columns could be added after a rule has been parsed and stored.\n *\n *\t  securityQuals is a list of security barrier quals (boolean expressions),\n *\t  to be tested in the listed order before returning a row from the\n *\t  relation.  It is always NIL in parser output.  Entries are added by the\n *\t  rewriter to implement security-barrier views and/or row-level security.\n *\t  Note that the planner turns each boolean expression into an implicitly\n *\t  AND'ed sublist, as is its usual habit with qualification expressions.\n *--------------------\n */\n"

The actual\n * structure of the GROUP BY clause is given by the groupingSets tree.\n *\n * In the raw parser output, GroupingSet nodes (of all types except SIMPLE\n * which is not used) are potentially mixed in with the expressions in the\n * groupClause of the SelectStmt.  (An expression can't contain a GroupingSet,\n * but a list may mix GroupingSet and expression nodes.)  At this stage, the\n * content of each node is a list of expressions, some of which may be RowExprs\n * which represent sublists rather than actual row constructors, and nested\n * GroupingSet nodes where legal in the grammar.  The structure directly\n * reflects the query syntax.\n *\n * In parse analysis, the transformed expressions are used to build the tlist\n * and groupClause list (of SortGroupClause nodes), and the groupingSets tree\n * is eventually reduced to a fixed format:\n *\n * EMPTY nodes represent (), and obviously have no content\n *\n * SIMPLE nodes represent a list of one or more expressions to be treated as an\n * atom by the enclosing structure; the content is an integer list of\n * ressortgroupref values (see SortGroupClause)\n *\n * CUBE and ROLLUP nodes contain a list of one or more SIMPLE nodes.\n *\n * SETS nodes contain a list of EMPTY, SIMPLE, CUBE or ROLLUP nodes, but after\n * parse analysis they cannot contain more SETS nodes; enough of the syntactic\n * transforms of the spec have been applied that we no longer have arbitrarily\n * deep nesting (though we still preserve the use of cube/rollup).\n *\n * Note that if the groupingSets tree contains no SIMPLE nodes (only EMPTY\n * nodes at the leaves), then the groupClause will be empty, but this is still\n * an aggregation query (similar to using aggs or HAVING without GROUP BY).\n *\n * As an example, the following clause:\n *\n * GROUP BY GROUPING SETS ((a,b), CUBE(c,(d,e)))\n *\n * looks like this after raw parsing:\n *\n * SETS( RowExpr(a,b) , CUBE( c, RowExpr(d,e) ) )\n *\n * and parse analysis converts it to:\n *\n * SETS( SIMPLE(1,2), CUBE( SIMPLE(3), SIMPLE(4,5) ) )\n */\n"
