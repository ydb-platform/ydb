 * LogwrtResult indicates the byte positions we have already written/fsynced.
 * These structs are identical but are declared separately to indicate their
 * slightly different functions.
 *
 * To read XLogCtl->LogwrtResult, you must hold either info_lck or
 * WALWriteLock.  To update it, you need to hold both locks.  The point of
 * this arrangement is that the value can be examined by code that already
 * holds WALWriteLock without needing to grab info_lck as well.  In addition
 * to the shared variable, each backend has a private copy of LogwrtResult,
 * which is updated when convenient.
 *
 * The request bookkeeping is simpler: there is a shared XLogCtl->LogwrtRqst
 * (protected by info_lck), but we don't need to cache any copies of it.
 *
 * info_lck is only held long enough to read/update the protected variables,
 * so it's a plain spinlock.  The other locks are held longer (potentially
 * over I/O operations), so we use LWLocks for them.  These locks are:
 *
 * WALBufMappingLock: must be held to replace a page in the WAL buffer cache.
 * It is only held while initializing and changing the mapping.  If the
 * contents of the buffer being replaced haven't been written yet, the mapping
 * lock is released while the write is done, and reacquired afterwards.
 *
 * WALWriteLock: must be held to write WAL buffers to disk (XLogWrite or
 * XLogFlush).
 *
 * ControlFileLock: must be held to read/update control file or create
 * new log file.

/*
 * Inserting to WAL is protected by a small fixed number of WAL insertion
 * locks. To insert to the WAL, you must hold one of the locks - it doesn't
 * matter which one. To lock out other concurrent insertions, you must hold
 * of them. Each WAL insertion lock consists of a lightweight lock, plus an
 * indicator of how far the insertion has progressed (insertingAt).
 *
 * The insertingAt values are read when a process wants to flush WAL from
 * the in-memory buffers to disk, to check that all the insertions to the
 * region the process is about to write out have finished. You could simply
 * wait for all currently in-progress insertions to finish, but the
 * insertingAt indicator allows you to ignore insertions to later in the WAL,
 * so that you only wait for the insertions that are modifying the buffers
 * you're about to write out.
 *
 * This isn't just an optimization. If all the WAL buffers are dirty, an
 * inserter that's holding a WAL insert lock might need to evict an old WAL
 * buffer, which requires flushing the WAL. If it's possible for an inserter
 * to block on another inserter unnecessarily, deadlock can arise when two
 * inserters holding a WAL insert lock wait for each other to finish their
 * insertion.
 *
 * Small WAL records that don't cross a page boundary never update the value,
 * the WAL record is just copied to the page and the lock is released. But
 * to avoid the deadlock-scenario explained above, the indicator is always
 * updated before sleeping while holding an insertion lock.
 *
 * lastImportantAt contains the LSN of the last important WAL record inserted
 * using a given lock. This value is used to detect if there has been
 * important WAL activity since the last time some action, like a checkpoint,
 * was performed - allowing to not repeat the action if not. The LSN is
 * updated for all insertions, unless the XLOG_MARK_UNIMPORTANT flag was
 * set. lastImportantAt is never cleared, only overwritten by the LSN of newer
 * records.  Tracking the WAL activity directly in WALInsertLock has the
 * advantage of not needing any additional locks to update the value.

	 *
	 * 1. Reserve the right amount of space from the WAL. The current head of
	 *	  reserved space is kept in Insert->CurrBytePos, and is protected by
	 *	  insertpos_lck.
	 *
	 * 2. Copy the record to the reserved WAL space. This involves finding the
	 *	  correct WAL buffer containing the reserved space, and copying the
	 *	  record in place. This can be done concurrently in multiple processes.
	 *
	 * To keep track of which insertions are still in-progress, each concurrent
	 * inserter acquires an insertion lock. In addition to just indicating that
	 * an insertion is in progress, the lock tells others how far the inserter
	 * has progressed. There is a small fixed number of insertion locks,
	 * determined by NUM_XLOGINSERT_LOCKS. When an inserter crosses a page
	 * boundary, it updates the value stored in the lock to the how far it has
	 * inserted, to allow the previous buffer to be flushed.
	 *
	 * Holding onto an insertion lock also protects RedoRecPtr and
	 * fullPageWrites from changing until the insertion is finished.
	 *
	 * Step 2 can usually be done completely in parallel. If the required WAL
	 * page is not initialized yet, you have to grab WALBufMappingLock to
	 * initialize it, but the WAL writer tries to do that ahead of insertions
	 * to avoid that from happening in the critical path.

 *
 * If !shutdown then we are writing an online checkpoint. This is a very special
 * kind of operation and WAL record because the checkpoint action occurs over
 * a period of time yet logically occurs at just a single LSN. The logical
 * position of the WAL record (redo ptr) is the same or earlier than the
 * physical position. When we replay WAL we locate the checkpoint via its
 * physical position then read the redo ptr and actually start replay at the
 * earlier logical position. Note that we don't write *anything* to WAL at
 * the logical position, so that location could be any other kind of WAL record.
 * All of this mechanism allows us to continue working while we checkpoint.
 * As a result, timing of actions is critical here and be careful to note that
 * this function will likely take minutes to execute on a busy system.

 * backup is started with pg_start_backup(), and there can be only one active
 * at a time. The backup and tablespace map files of an exclusive backup are
 * written to $PGDATA/backup_label and $PGDATA/tablespace_map, and they are
 * removed by pg_stop_backup().
 *
 * A non-exclusive backup is used for the streaming base backups (see
 * src/backend/replication/basebackup.c). The difference to exclusive backups
 * is that the backup label and tablespace map files are not written to disk.
 * Instead, their would-be contents are returned in *labelfile and *tblspcmapfile,
 * and the caller is responsible for including them in the backup archive as
 * 'backup_label' and 'tablespace_map'. There can be many non-exclusive backups
 * active at the same time, and they don't conflict with an exclusive backup
 * either.
 *
 * labelfile and tblspcmapfile must be passed as NULL when starting an
 * exclusive backup, and as initially-empty StringInfos for a non-exclusive
 * backup.
 *
 * If "tablespaces" isn't NULL, it receives a list of tablespaceinfo structs
 * describing the cluster's tablespaces.
 *
 * tblspcmapfile is required mainly for tar format in windows as native windows
 * utilities are not able to create symlinks while extracting files from tar.
 * However for consistency, the same is used for all platforms.
 *
 * Returns the minimum WAL location that must be present to restore from this
 * backup, and the corresponding timeline ID in *starttli_p.

 * do_pg_stop_backup() or do_pg_abort_backup().
