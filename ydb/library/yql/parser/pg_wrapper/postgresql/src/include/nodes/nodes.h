/*
 * pg_node_attr() - Used in node definitions to set extra information for
 * gen_node_support.pl
 *
 * Attributes can be attached to a node as a whole (place the attribute
 * specification on the first line after the struct's opening brace)
 * or to a specific field (place it at the end of that field's line).  The
 * argument is a comma-separated list of attributes.  Unrecognized attributes
 * cause an error.
 *
 * Valid node attributes:
 *
 * - abstract: Abstract types are types that cannot be instantiated but that
 *   can be supertypes of other types.  We track their fields, so that
 *   subtypes can use them, but we don't emit a node tag, so you can't
 *   instantiate them.
 *
 * - custom_copy_equal: Has custom implementations in copyfuncs.c and
 *   equalfuncs.c.
 *
 * - custom_read_write: Has custom implementations in outfuncs.c and
 *   readfuncs.c.
 *
 * - custom_query_jumble: Has custom implementation in queryjumblefuncs.c.
 *
 * - no_copy: Does not support copyObject() at all.
 *
 * - no_equal: Does not support equal() at all.
 *
 * - no_copy_equal: Shorthand for both no_copy and no_equal.
 *
 * - no_query_jumble: Does not support JumbleQuery() at all.
 *
 * - no_read: Does not support nodeRead() at all.
 *
 * - nodetag_only: Does not support copyObject(), equal(), jumbleQuery()
 *   outNode() or nodeRead().
 *
 * - special_read_write: Has special treatment in outNode() and nodeRead().
 *
 * - nodetag_number(VALUE): assign the specified nodetag number instead of
 *   an auto-generated number.  Typically this would only be used in stable
 *   branches, to give a newly-added node type a number without breaking ABI
 *   by changing the numbers of existing node types.
 *
 * Node types can be supertypes of other types whether or not they are marked
 * abstract: if a node struct appears as the first field of another struct
 * type, then it is the supertype of that type.  The no_copy, no_equal,
 * no_query_jumble and no_read node attributes are automatically inherited
 * from the supertype.  (Notice that nodetag_only does not inherit, so it's
 * not quite equivalent to a combination of other attributes.)
 *
 * Valid node field attributes:
 *
 * - array_size(OTHERFIELD): This field is a dynamically allocated array with
 *   size indicated by the mentioned other field.  The other field is either a
 *   scalar or a list, in which case the length of the list is used.
 *
 * - copy_as(VALUE): In copyObject(), replace the field's value with VALUE.
 *
 * - copy_as_scalar: In copyObject(), copy the field as a scalar value
 *   (e.g. a pointer) even if it is a node-type pointer.
 *
 * - equal_as_scalar: In equal(), compare the field as a scalar value
 *   even if it is a node-type pointer.
 *
 * - equal_ignore: Ignore the field for equality.
 *
 * - equal_ignore_if_zero: Ignore the field for equality if it is zero.
 *   (Otherwise, compare normally.)
 *
 * - query_jumble_ignore: Ignore the field for the query jumbling.  Note
 *   that typmod and collation information are usually irrelevant for the
 *   query jumbling.
 *
 * - query_jumble_location: Mark the field as a location to track.  This is
 *   only allowed for integer fields that include "location" in their name.
 *
 * - read_as(VALUE): In nodeRead(), replace the field's value with VALUE.
 *
 * - read_write_ignore: Ignore the field for read/write.  This is only allowed
 *   if the node type is marked no_read or read_as() is also specified.
 *
 * - write_only_relids, write_only_nondefault_pathtarget, write_only_req_outer:
 *   Special handling for Path struct; see there.
