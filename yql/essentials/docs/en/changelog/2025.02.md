## Changing the visibility of aliases entered in GROUP BY expr AS alias for WHERE {#group-by-expr-alias-where}

Since this version, in a query like

```yql
SELECT foo, ... WHERE foo = 1 GROUP BY expr AS foo
```

the value of foo in `WHERE` is taken from the original table, and not equal to `expr` as it was previously.

To get an error from the query if it changes behavior in this version, you need to add

```yql
PRAGMA FailOnGroupByExprOverride;
```

If you want to keep the previous behavior, you need to transform the query into this form:

```yql
SELECT foo, ... FROM (SELECT expr AS foo ...) WHERE foo = 1 GROUP BY foo
```

If you need to prepare the query for the transition to a new version, it is enough to remove the shadowing of the column name by the alias:

```yql
SELECT foo_new, ... WHERE foo = 1 GROUP BY expr AS foo_new
```
