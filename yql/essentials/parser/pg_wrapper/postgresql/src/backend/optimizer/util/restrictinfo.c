 * The API would be a bit clearer if we passed the current relids and the
 * outer relids separately and did bms_union internally; but since most
 * callers need to apply this function to multiple clauses, we make the
 * caller perform the union.
 *
 * Obviously, the clause must only refer to Vars available from the current
 * relation plus the outer rels.  We also check that it does reference at
 * least one current Var, ensuring that the clause will be pushed down to
 * a unique place in a parameterized join tree.  And we check that we're
 * not pushing the clause into its outer-join outer side.
 *
 * We used to need to check that we're not pushing the clause into a lower
 * outer join's inner side.  However, now that clause_relids includes
 * references to potentially-nulling outer joins, the other tests handle that
 * concern.  If the clause references any Var coming from the inside of a
 * lower outer join, its clause_relids will mention that outer join, causing
 * the evaluability check to fail; while if it references no such Vars, the
 * references-a-target-rel check will fail.
 *
 * There's no check here equivalent to join_clause_is_movable_to's test on
 * lateral_referencers.  We assume the caller wouldn't be inquiring unless
 * it'd verified that the proposed outer rels don't have lateral references
 * to the current rel(s).  (If we are considering join paths with the outer
 * rels on the outside and the current rels on the inside, then this should
 * have been checked at the outset of such consideration; see join_is_legal
 * and the path parameterization checks in joinpath.c.)  On the other hand,
 * in join_clause_is_movable_to we are asking whether the clause could be
 * moved for some valid set of outer rels, so we don't have the benefit of
 * relying on prior checks for lateral-reference validity.
 *
 * Likewise, we don't check is_clone here: rejecting the inappropriate
 * variants of a cloned clause must be handled upstream.
 *
 * Note: if this returns true, it means that the clause could be moved to
 * this join relation, but that doesn't mean that this is the lowest join
 * it could be moved to.  Caller may need to make additional calls to verify
 * that this doesn't succeed on either of the inputs of a proposed join.
 *
 * Note: get_joinrel_parampathinfo depends on the fact that if
 * current_and_outer is NULL, this function will always return false
 * (since one or the other of the first two tests must fail).
