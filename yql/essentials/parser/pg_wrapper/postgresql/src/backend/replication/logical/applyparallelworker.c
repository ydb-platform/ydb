 * applyparallelworker.c
 *	   Support routines for applying xact by parallel apply worker
 *
 * Copyright (c) 2023, PostgreSQL Global Development Group
 *
 * IDENTIFICATION
 *	  src/backend/replication/logical/applyparallelworker.c
 *
 * This file contains the code to launch, set up, and teardown a parallel apply
 * worker which receives the changes from the leader worker and invokes routines
 * to apply those on the subscriber database. Additionally, this file contains
 * routines that are intended to support setting up, using, and tearing down a
 * ParallelApplyWorkerInfo which is required so the leader worker and parallel
 * apply workers can communicate with each other.
 *
 * The parallel apply workers are assigned (if available) as soon as xact's
 * first stream is received for subscriptions that have set their 'streaming'
 * option as parallel. The leader apply worker will send changes to this new
 * worker via shared memory. We keep this worker assigned till the transaction
 * commit is received and also wait for the worker to finish at commit. This
 * preserves commit ordering and avoid file I/O in most cases, although we
 * still need to spill to a file if there is no worker available. See comments
 * atop logical/worker to know more about streamed xacts whose changes are
 * spilled to disk. It is important to maintain commit order to avoid failures
 * due to: (a) transaction dependencies - say if we insert a row in the first
 * transaction and update it in the second transaction on publisher then
 * allowing the subscriber to apply both in parallel can lead to failure in the
 * update; (b) deadlocks - allowing transactions that update the same set of
 * rows/tables in the opposite order to be applied in parallel can lead to
 * deadlocks.
 *
 * A worker pool is used to avoid restarting workers for each streaming
 * transaction. We maintain each worker's information (ParallelApplyWorkerInfo)
 * in the ParallelApplyWorkerPool. After successfully launching a new worker,
 * its information is added to the ParallelApplyWorkerPool. Once the worker
 * finishes applying the transaction, it is marked as available for re-use.
 * Now, before starting a new worker to apply the streaming transaction, we
 * check the list for any available worker. Note that we retain a maximum of
 * half the max_parallel_apply_workers_per_subscription workers in the pool and
 * after that, we simply exit the worker after applying the transaction.
 *
 * XXX This worker pool threshold is arbitrary and we can provide a GUC
 * variable for this in the future if required.
 *
 * The leader apply worker will create a separate dynamic shared memory segment
 * when each parallel apply worker starts. The reason for this design is that
 * we cannot predict how many workers will be needed. It may be possible to
 * allocate enough shared memory in one segment based on the maximum number of
 * parallel apply workers (max_parallel_apply_workers_per_subscription), but
 * this would waste memory if no process is actually started.
 *
 * The dynamic shared memory segment contains: (a) a shm_mq that is used to
 * send changes in the transaction from leader apply worker to parallel apply
 * worker; (b) another shm_mq that is used to send errors (and other messages
 * reported via elog/ereport) from the parallel apply worker to leader apply
 * worker; (c) necessary information to be shared among parallel apply workers
 * and the leader apply worker (i.e. members of ParallelApplyWorkerShared).
 *
 * Locking Considerations
 * ----------------------
 * We have a risk of deadlock due to concurrently applying the transactions in
 * parallel mode that were independent on the publisher side but became
 * dependent on the subscriber side due to the different database structures
 * (like schema of subscription tables, constraints, etc.) on each side. This
 * can happen even without parallel mode when there are concurrent operations
 * on the subscriber. In order to detect the deadlocks among leader (LA) and
 * parallel apply (PA) workers, we used lmgr locks when the PA waits for the
 * next stream (set of changes) and LA waits for PA to finish the transaction.
 * An alternative approach could be to not allow parallelism when the schema of
 * tables is different between the publisher and subscriber but that would be
 * too restrictive and would require the publisher to send much more
 * information than it is currently sending.
 *
 * Consider a case where the subscribed table does not have a unique key on the
 * publisher and has a unique key on the subscriber. The deadlock can happen in
 * the following ways:
 *
 * 1) Deadlock between the leader apply worker and a parallel apply worker
 *
 * Consider that the parallel apply worker (PA) is executing TX-1 and the
 * leader apply worker (LA) is executing TX-2 concurrently on the subscriber.
 * Now, LA is waiting for PA because of the unique key constraint of the
 * subscribed table while PA is waiting for LA to send the next stream of
 * changes or transaction finish command message.
 *
 * In order for lmgr to detect this, we have LA acquire a session lock on the
 * remote transaction (by pa_lock_stream()) and have PA wait on the lock before
 * trying to receive the next stream of changes. Specifically, LA will acquire
 * the lock in AccessExclusive mode before sending the STREAM_STOP and will
 * release it if already acquired after sending the STREAM_START, STREAM_ABORT
 * (for toplevel transaction), STREAM_PREPARE, and STREAM_COMMIT. The PA will
 * acquire the lock in AccessShare mode after processing STREAM_STOP and
 * STREAM_ABORT (for subtransaction) and then release the lock immediately
 * after acquiring it.
 *
 * The lock graph for the above example will look as follows:
 * LA (waiting to acquire the lock on the unique index) -> PA (waiting to
 * acquire the stream lock) -> LA
 *
 * This way, when PA is waiting for LA for the next stream of changes, we can
 * have a wait-edge from PA to LA in lmgr, which will make us detect the
 * deadlock between LA and PA.
 *
 * 2) Deadlock between the leader apply worker and parallel apply workers
 *
 * This scenario is similar to the first case but TX-1 and TX-2 are executed by
 * two parallel apply workers (PA-1 and PA-2 respectively). In this scenario,
 * PA-2 is waiting for PA-1 to complete its transaction while PA-1 is waiting
 * for subsequent input from LA. Also, LA is waiting for PA-2 to complete its
 * transaction in order to preserve the commit order. There is a deadlock among
 * the three processes.
 *
 * In order for lmgr to detect this, we have PA acquire a session lock (this is
 * a different lock than referred in the previous case, see
 * pa_lock_transaction()) on the transaction being applied and have LA wait on
 * the lock before proceeding in the transaction finish commands. Specifically,
 * PA will acquire this lock in AccessExclusive mode before executing the first
 * message of the transaction and release it at the xact end. LA will acquire
 * this lock in AccessShare mode at transaction finish commands and release it
 * immediately.
 *
 * The lock graph for the above example will look as follows:
 * LA (waiting to acquire the transaction lock) -> PA-2 (waiting to acquire the
 * lock due to unique index constraint) -> PA-1 (waiting to acquire the stream
 * lock) -> LA
 *
 * This way when LA is waiting to finish the transaction end command to preserve
 * the commit order, we will be able to detect deadlock, if any.
 *
 * One might think we can use XactLockTableWait(), but XactLockTableWait()
 * considers PREPARED TRANSACTION as still in progress which means the lock
 * won't be released even after the parallel apply worker has prepared the
 * transaction.
 *
 * 3) Deadlock when the shm_mq buffer is full
 *
 * In the previous scenario (ie. PA-1 and PA-2 are executing transactions
 * concurrently), if the shm_mq buffer between LA and PA-2 is full, LA has to
 * wait to send messages, and this wait doesn't appear in lmgr.
 *
 * To avoid this wait, we use a non-blocking write and wait with a timeout. If
 * the timeout is exceeded, the LA will serialize all the pending messages to
 * a file and indicate PA-2 that it needs to read that file for the remaining
 * messages. Then LA will start waiting for commit as in the previous case
 * which will detect deadlock if any. See pa_send_data() and
 * enum TransApplyAction.
 *
 * Lock types
 * ----------
 * Both the stream lock and the transaction lock mentioned above are
 * session-level locks because both locks could be acquired outside the
 * transaction, and the stream lock in the leader needs to persist across
 * transaction boundaries i.e. until the end of the streaming transaction.
