 *
 *		Bootstrapping these lookups is very hard.  We want to be able to
 *		use an index on pg_attribute, for example, but in order to do so,
 *		we must have read pg_attribute for the attributes in the index,
 *		which implies that we need to use the index.
 *
 *		In order to get around the problem, we do the following:
 *
 *		   +  When the database system is initialized (at initdb time), we
 *			  don't use indexes.  We do sequential scans.
 *
 *		   +  When the backend is started up in normal mode, we load an image
 *			  of the appropriate relation descriptors, in internal format,
 *			  from an initialization file in the data/base/... directory.
 *
 *		   +  If the initialization file isn't there, then we create the
 *			  relation descriptors using sequential scans and write 'em to
 *			  the initialization file for use by subsequent backends.
 *
 *		As of Postgres 9.0, there is one local initialization file in each
 *		database, plus one shared initialization file for shared catalogs.
 *
 *		We could dispense with the initialization files and just build the
 *		critical reldescs the hard way on every backend startup, but that
 *		slows down backend startup noticeably.
 *
 *		We can in fact go further, and save more relcache entries than
 *		just the ones that are absolutely critical; this allows us to speed
 *		up backend startup by not having to build such entries the hard way.
 *		Presently, all the catalog and index entries that are referred to
 *		by catcaches are stored in the initialization files.
 *
 *		The same mechanism that detects when catcache and relcache entries
 *		need to be invalidated (due to catalog updates) also arranges to
 *		unlink the initialization files when the contents may be out of date.
 *		The files will then be rebuilt during the next backend startup.
