 * tuplesort.c
 *	  Generalized tuple sorting routines.
 *
 * This module provides a generalized facility for tuple sorting, which can be
 * applied to different kinds of sortable objects.  Implementation of
 * the particular sorting variants is given in tuplesortvariants.c.
 * This module works efficiently for both small and large amounts
 * of data.  Small amounts are sorted in-memory using qsort().  Large
 * amounts are sorted using temporary files and a standard external sort
 * algorithm.
 *
 * See Knuth, volume 3, for more than you want to know about external
 * sorting algorithms.  The algorithm we use is a balanced k-way merge.
 * Before PostgreSQL 15, we used the polyphase merge algorithm (Knuth's
 * Algorithm 5.4.2D), but with modern hardware, a straightforward balanced
 * merge is better.  Knuth is assuming that tape drives are expensive
 * beasts, and in particular that there will always be many more runs than
 * tape drives.  The polyphase merge algorithm was good at keeping all the
 * tape drives busy, but in our implementation a "tape drive" doesn't cost
 * much more than a few Kb of memory buffers, so we can afford to have
 * lots of them.  In particular, if we can have as many tape drives as
 * sorted runs, we can eliminate any repeated I/O at all.
 *
 * Historically, we divided the input into sorted runs using replacement
 * selection, in the form of a priority tree implemented as a heap
 * (essentially Knuth's Algorithm 5.2.3H), but now we always use quicksort
 * for run generation.
 *
 * The approximate amount of memory allowed for any one sort operation
 * is specified in kilobytes by the caller (most pass work_mem).  Initially,
 * we absorb tuples and simply store them in an unsorted array as long as
 * we haven't exceeded workMem.  If we reach the end of the input without
 * exceeding workMem, we sort the array using qsort() and subsequently return
 * tuples just by scanning the tuple array sequentially.  If we do exceed
 * workMem, we begin to emit tuples into sorted runs in temporary tapes.
 * When tuples are dumped in batch after quicksorting, we begin a new run
 * with a new output tape.  If we reach the max number of tapes, we write
 * subsequent runs on the existing tapes in a round-robin fashion.  We will
 * need multiple merge passes to finish the merge in that case.  After the
 * end of the input is reached, we dump out remaining tuples in memory into
 * a final run, then merge the runs.
 *
 * When merging runs, we use a heap containing just the frontmost tuple from
 * each source run; we repeatedly output the smallest tuple and replace it
 * with the next tuple from its source tape (if any).  When the heap empties,
 * the merge is complete.  The basic merge algorithm thus needs very little
 * memory --- only M tuples for an M-way merge, and M is constrained to a
 * small number.  However, we can still make good use of our full workMem
 * allocation by pre-reading additional blocks from each source tape.  Without
 * prereading, our access pattern to the temporary file would be very erratic;
 * on average we'd read one block from each of M source tapes during the same
 * time that we're writing M blocks to the output tape, so there is no
 * sequentiality of access at all, defeating the read-ahead methods used by
 * most Unix kernels.  Worse, the output tape gets written into a very random
 * sequence of blocks of the temp file, ensuring that things will be even
 * worse when it comes time to read that tape.  A straightforward merge pass
 * thus ends up doing a lot of waiting for disk seeks.  We can improve matters
 * by prereading from each source tape sequentially, loading about workMem/M
 * bytes from each tape in turn, and making the sequential blocks immediately
 * available for reuse.  This approach helps to localize both read and write
 * accesses.  The pre-reading is handled by logtape.c, we just tell it how
 * much memory to use for the buffers.
 *
 * In the current code we determine the number of input tapes M on the basis
 * of workMem: we want workMem/M to be large enough that we read a fair
 * amount of data each time we read from a tape, so as to maintain the
 * locality of access described above.  Nonetheless, with large workMem we
 * can have many tapes.  The logical "tapes" are implemented by logtape.c,
 * which avoids space wastage by recycling disk space as soon as each block
 * is read from its "tape".
 *
 * When the caller requests random access to the sort result, we form
 * the final sorted run on a logical tape which is then "frozen", so
 * that we can access it randomly.  When the caller does not need random
 * access, we return from tuplesort_performsort() as soon as we are down
 * to one run per logical tape.  The final merge is then performed
 * on-the-fly as the caller repeatedly calls tuplesort_getXXX; this
 * saves one cycle of writing all the data out to disk and reading it in.
 *
 * This module supports parallel sorting.  Parallel sorts involve coordination
 * among one or more worker processes, and a leader process, each with its own
 * tuplesort state.  The leader process (or, more accurately, the
 * Tuplesortstate associated with a leader process) creates a full tapeset
 * consisting of worker tapes with one run to merge; a run for every
 * worker process.  This is then merged.  Worker processes are guaranteed to
 * produce exactly one output run from their partial input.

 * NOTES about on-tape representation of tuples:
 *
 * We require the first "unsigned int" of a stored tuple to be the total size
 * on-tape of the tuple, including itself (so it is never zero; an all-zero
 * unsigned int is used to delimit runs).  The remainder of the stored tuple
 * may or may not match the in-memory representation of the tuple ---
 * any conversion needed is the job of the writetup and readtup routines.
 *
 * If state->sortopt contains TUPLESORT_RANDOMACCESS, then the stored
 * representation of the tuple must be followed by another "unsigned int" that
 * is a copy of the length --- so the total tape space used is actually
 * sizeof(unsigned int) more than the stored length value.  This allows
 * read-backwards.  When the random access flag was not specified, the
 * write/read routines may omit the extra length word.
 *
 * writetup is expected to write both length words as well as the tuple
 * data.  When readtup is called, the tape is positioned just after the
 * front length word; readtup must read the tuple data and advance past
 * the back length word (if present).
 *
 * The write/read routines can make use of the tuple description data
 * stored in the Tuplesortstate record, if needed.  They are also expected
 * to adjust state->availMem by the amount of memory space (not tape space!)
 * released or consumed.  There is no error return from either writetup
 * or readtup; they should ereport() on failure.
 *
 *
 * NOTES about memory consumption calculations:
 *
 * We count space allocated for tuples against the workMem limit, plus
 * the space used by the variable-size memtuples array.  Fixed-size space
 * is not counted; it's small enough to not be interesting.
 *
 * Note that we count actual space used (as shown by GetMemoryChunkSpace)
 * rather than the originally-requested size.  This is important since
 * palloc can add substantial overhead.  It's not a complete answer since
 * we won't count any wasted space in palloc allocation blocks, but it's
 * a lot better than what we were doing before 7.3.  As of 9.6, a
 * separate memory context is used for caller passed tuples.  Resetting
 * it at certain key increments significantly ameliorates fragmentation.
 * readtup routines use the slab allocator (they cannot use
 * the reset context because it gets deleted at the point that merging
 * begins).
