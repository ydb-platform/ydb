 * Behaviour of replication slots, upon release or crash.

 * Slots marked as PERSISTENT are crash-safe and will not be dropped when
 * released. Slots marked as EPHEMERAL will be dropped when released or after
 * restarts.  Slots marked TEMPORARY will be dropped at the end of a session
 * or on error.
 *
 * EPHEMERAL is used as a not-quite-ready state when creating persistent
 * slots.  EPHEMERAL slots can be made PERSISTENT by calling
 * ReplicationSlotPersist().  For a slot that goes away at the end of a
 * session, TEMPORARY is the appropriate choice.

 * mode when updating the flag by the backend owning the slot and doing the
 * operation, while readers (concurrent backends not owning the slot) need
 * to hold it in shared mode when looking at replication slot data.
 * - Individual fields are protected by mutex where only the backend owning
 * the slot is authorized to update the fields from its own slot.  The
 * backend owning the slot does not need to take this lock when reading its
 * own fields, while concurrent backends not owning this slot should take the
