 * erand48.c
 *
 * This file supplies pg_erand48() and related functions, which except
 * for the names are just like the POSIX-standard erand48() family.
 * (We don't supply the full set though, only the ones we have found use
 * for in Postgres.  In particular, we do *not* implement lcong48(), so
 * that there is no need for the multiplier and addend to be variable.)
 *
 * We used to test for an operating system version rather than
 * unconditionally using our own, but (1) some versions of Cygwin have a
 * buggy erand48() that always returns zero and (2) as of 2011, glibc's
 * erand48() is strangely coded to be almost-but-not-quite thread-safe,
 * which doesn't matter for the backend but is important for pgbench.
